# The logic to check if the lending pool defaults does not match the logic to check if the pool default on Goldfinch side.

## Summary

The logic to check if the lending pool defaults is not accurate

## Vulnerability Detail

in the current implementation, the code check if the lending pool defaults using the below:

```solidity
if (_previousStatus == LendingPoolStatus.Late) {
        /// Once there is a late payment, we wait for 2 payment periods.
        /// After 2 payment periods are elapsed, either full payment is going to be made or not.
        /// If all missed payments(full payment) are made, then a pool goes back to active.
        /// If full payment is not made, then this lending pool is in the default state.
        if (
          block.timestamp >
          (lendingPoolStateDetail.lateTimestamp +
            _getTwoPaymentPeriodsInSeconds(poolState, _lendingPool))
        ) {
          /// State transition 2: Late -> Active
          if (_currentStatus == LendingPoolStatus.Active) {
            /// Update the current status of the lending pool to Active
            /// and move the lending pool to the active state
            lendingPoolStateDetail.currentStatus = LendingPoolStatus.Active;
            _moveFromLockedToActiveState(poolState, _lendingPool);

            /// Clear the late timestamp
            lendingPoolStateDetail.lateTimestamp = 0;
          }
          /// State transition 3: Late -> Defaulted
          else if (_currentStatus == LendingPoolStatus.Late) {
            /// Update the current status of the lending pool to Active
            lendingPoolStateDetail.currentStatus = LendingPoolStatus.Defaulted;

            // Default state transition will be implemented in the next version of the protocol
            // _moveFromLockedToDefaultedState(poolState, _lendingPool);
          }
        }
      }
```

if the payment is the latest and after two payment cycles, if the current state is active, move the state back to active and unlock capital 

Otherwise, mark the lending pool default and there is no way to recover from default state.

Note the check:

```solidity
        if (
          block.timestamp >
          (lendingPoolStateDetail.lateTimestamp +
            _getTwoPaymentPeriodsInSeconds(poolState, _lendingPool))
        )
```

which calls:

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Returns the two payment periods in seconds for a given lending pool.
   * @param poolState The stored state of the protection pool
   * @param _lendingPool The address of the lending pool
   * @return The two payment periods in seconds for a given lending pool
   */
  function _getTwoPaymentPeriodsInSeconds(
    ProtectionPoolState storage poolState,
    address _lendingPool
  ) internal view returns (uint256) {
    /// Retrieve the payment period in days for the given lending pool and convert it to seconds
    return
      (poolState
        .protectionPool
        .getPoolInfo()
        .referenceLendingPools
        .getPaymentPeriodInDays(_lendingPool) * 2) *
      Constants.SECONDS_IN_DAY_UINT;
  }
```
which basically calls:

```solidity
  /// @inheritdoc ILendingProtocolAdapter
  function getPaymentPeriodInDays(address _lendingPool)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    return _getCreditLine(_lendingPool).paymentPeriodInDays();
  }
```

However, such check is not accurate and on Goldfinch side, the logic to check if the pool defaults is different.

According to:

https://docs.goldfinch.finance/goldfinch/protocol-mechanics/default-process

> Borrowers make monthly interest payments to their Pools to service their debt, as defined in the Pool terms.
When a Borrower misses an interest payment date, defined by their off-chain agreement, or breaks any other provision in their off-chain agreement: 

> Off-chain: Borrower enters a 3-7 (exact dates vary by pool according to what investors negotiated for) grace period to remediate the missed payment, or broken provision. 
On-chain: Borrower enters a 45 day grace period before the protocol marks the loan on-chain as being in default, and starts provisioning the loan.

> After 45 days of non-payment, the loan officially enters default status on-chain. 

> The Pool is now subject to its default interest rate as defined in the Pool terms: 
For Senior Pool investors, the value of the loan will on a daily linear basis, be automatically written down over 120 days. If repayments are eventually made, then the writedown will be reversed accordingly. 
For Backers in a given pool, no writedown mechanics are necessary since there is already a defined waterfall and pro rata distribution. 

The default process on Goldfinch side is not checking if after two payment cycles the debt is paid.

On Goldfinch side, the logic check if the pool is within the off-chain grace period and on-chain grace period, then enters the default state.

## Impact

The protocol may incorrectly mark the pool that is not the default to default status or when the pool default after 48 (45 on-chain grace period + off-chain grace period) days period, the protocol still have to wait for full two payment cycle to mark the lending pool as default. The protection buyer cannot exercise their protection immediately after the pool default.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol make sure the logic to check if a lending pool defaults matches the logic from Goldfinch to make sure not marking a healthy lending pool to default status or delay the protection payment if the pool goes to defauts.
