# The cycle states in `poolCycleManager` should be updated before used in `_requestWithdrawal`



## Summary
`ProtectionPool._requestWithdrawal` don't update the cycle states of `poolCycleManager` before it uses cycle information, so it can cause wrong activities.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ProtectionPool._requestWithdrawal`, it requests withdrawal in the cycle after the next cycle. So it gets current cycle index from `poolCycleManager` and requests withdrawal in the cycle whose number is `_currentCycleIndex` + 2.

```solidity
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );
```
```solidity
    uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;
```

But there can be a situation when the current cycle is expired. The cycle is advanced in `PoolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` by a cron job. So if the user front-run this cron job, he can request his withdrawal in the next cycle instead of the cycle after the next cycle when the current cycle is expired. 

## Impact
The depositor can request withdrawal earlier than it should be by front-running the cron job.

## Recommendation
Call `poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` first in the `ProtectionPool._requestWithdrawal` before `poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex` is called.
