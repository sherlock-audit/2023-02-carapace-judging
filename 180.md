# The ````accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```` may be unavailable while there are many buys or under DoS attack

## Summary
The ````_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```` called by ````accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```` has unbound loop on all active ````ProtectionInfo```` in the pool. While there are many buys or under DoS attack, the ````accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```` will cost too much gas, lead to transaction for calling it can't be included into block.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown of L981 of ````_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```` function, all active protections in the pool are traversed. In each iteration, a whole ````ProtectionInfo ```` state variable is read and passed to ````ProtectionPoolHelper.verifyAndAccruePremium()```` function.
```solidity
File: contracts\core\pool\ProtectionPool.sol
0963:   function _accruePremiumAndExpireProtections(
...
0967:   )
...
0973:   {
...
0980:     uint256 _length = _protectionIndexes.length;
0981:     for (uint256 j; j < _length; ) {
0982:       uint256 _protectionIndex = _protectionIndexes[j];
0983:       ProtectionInfo storage protectionInfo = protectionInfos[_protectionIndex];
...
0987:       (
0988:         uint256 _accruedPremiumInUnderlying,
0989:         bool _expired
0990:       ) = ProtectionPoolHelper.verifyAndAccruePremium(
0991:           poolInfo,
0992:           protectionInfo,
0993:           _lastPremiumAccrualTimestamp,
0994:           _latestPaymentTimestamp
0995:         );
0996:       _accruedPremiumForLendingPool += _accruedPremiumInUnderlying;
0997: 
...
1016: 
1017:       unchecked {
1018:         ++j;
1019:       }
1020:     }
1021:   }
```

A check a the ````ProtectionInfo ```` struct, we can find it uses 10 storage slots. So a whole read needs 10 ````SLOAD```` operations which cost 21,000 gas in total.
```solidity
struct ProtectionInfo {
  address buyer;
  uint256 protectionPremium;
  uint256 startTimestamp;
  int256 K;
  int256 lambda;
  bool expired;
  ProtectionPurchaseParams purchaseParams;
}

struct ProtectionPurchaseParams {
  address lendingPoolAddress;
  uint256 nftLpTokenId;
  uint256 protectionAmount;
  uint256 protectionDurationInSeconds;
}
```

As the max gas limit of block is 30M, we can calculate the max active protections to block ````_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```` function by
```solidity
30M / 21000 = 1428
```
1428 is not a large number, may occur in the real world, especially when this project becomes popular.

## Impact
Premium can't be accrued, protections can't be expired. The protocol becomes unavailable.

## Recommendation
Allow to call ````accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```` with specified active protection list.
