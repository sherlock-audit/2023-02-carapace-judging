# After ProtectionPool moves from Locked to Active state subsequent depositors will lose their funds

## Summary
After a ProtectionPool moves from Locked to the Active state, there will be significantly more shares than there are underlying tokens. Existing shareholders will be able to burn their shares to withdraw funds from subsequent depositors.

## Vulnerability Detail
The exchange rate between a ProtectionPool's underlying tokens and its SToken, is calculated using two state variables: `totalSTokenUnderlying` and `totalSupply`. `totalSTokenUnderlying` represents the amount of underlying tokens deposited by protection sellers.
When a ProtectionPool is locked, some of the underlying tokens are reserved to cover the protection buyers. They are subtracted from the `totalSTokenUnderlying` variable. If the ProtectionPool recovers and goes back to the Active state, the exchange rate will drop significantly. Subsequent depositors will receive fewer shares than they should. And funds that are deposited can be fully withdrawn by existing shareholders.

Here's a quick example that leaves out some of the finer details to showcase the issue of the exchange rate:
1. Alice deposits 100 tokens to receive 100 SToken
2. The ProtectionPool is locked and 90 tokens are locked up.
3. The pool recovers
4. Bob deposits 100 tokens and receives $100 * 10/100 = 10$ shares.
5. Alice initiates a withdrawal using her 100 shares to withdraw all of the funds deposited by Bob.
6. Bob is left with 10 shares and the ProtectionPool with 10 underlying tokens

This also applies to withdrawing existing tokens without anybody else depositing new tokens. There will be a rush to be the first to withdraw any remaining funds since the STokens they hold are essentially worthless. The snapshot was already taken so even if the capital is unlocked they can withdraw it.

## Impact
Because of the broken exchange rate, subsequent depositors will receive fewer shares than they should. Existing shareholders will be able withdraw the depositor's funds.

## Code Snippet
In `lockCapital()` the locked funds are subtracted from `totalSTokenUnderlying`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L413-L423
```sol
    unchecked {
      /// step 3: Update total locked & available capital in storage
      if (totalSTokenUnderlying < _lockedAmount) {
        /// If totalSTokenUnderlying < _lockedAmount, then lock all available capital
        _lockedAmount = totalSTokenUnderlying;
        totalSTokenUnderlying = 0;
      } else {
        /// Reduce the total sToken underlying amount by the locked amount
        totalSTokenUnderlying -= _lockedAmount;
      }
    }
```

After a ProtectionPool is set to Active again, the `totalSTokenUnderlying` value remains unchanged. Because the exchange rate between underlying tokens and STokens depends on `totalSTokenUnderlying`, subsequent depositors will receive fewer shares than they should. The total supply of STokens remains unchanged even after the pool was locked: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L913-L931
```sol
  function _getExchangeRate() internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _totalScaledCapital = ProtectionPoolHelper
      .scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
        totalSTokenUnderlying,
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );
    uint256 _totalSTokenSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 _exchangeRate = (_totalScaledCapital *
      Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _totalSTokenSupply;

    console.log(
      "Total capital: %s, Total SToken Supply: %s, exchange rate: %s",
      _totalScaledCapital,
      _totalSTokenSupply,
      _exchangeRate
    );

    return _exchangeRate;
  }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There's no small change that would fix this problem. The issue is that underlying tokens will be removed from the pool while the issued shares (STokens) are not affected. When the pool is operating again, that imbalance will break the exchange rate. Since you can't just remove STokens (who's are you going to burn?) there's no clear fix.
