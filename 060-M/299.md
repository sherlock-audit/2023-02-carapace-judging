# `ProtectionPool.lockCapital()` might lock the already expired protection.



## Summary
`ProtectionPool.lockCapital()` is used to lock live protections when the status of the lending pool is `Late` by `DefaultStateManager`.

And `ProtectionPool.accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` checks live protections regularly and expires protections.

So lately expired protections might be in the `activeProtectionIndexes` for a while until `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` is called again.

As a result, when `ProtectionPool.lockCapital()` is called, it might lock already expired protections and it's not fair for sellers.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the `DefaultStateManager.assessStates()`, it calls `_moveFromActiveToLockedState()` if the status of the lending pool is `Late` and locks all live protections of the protection pool using `ProtectionPool.lockCapital()`.

```solidity
  function lockCapital(address _lendingPoolAddress)
    external
    payable
    override
    onlyDefaultStateManager
    whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256 _lockedAmount, uint256 _snapshotId)
  {
    /// step 1: Capture protection pool's current investors by creating a snapshot of the token balance by using ERC20Snapshot in SToken
    _snapshotId = _snapshot();

    /// step 2: calculate total capital to be locked
    LendingPoolDetail storage lendingPoolDetail = lendingPoolDetails[
      _lendingPoolAddress
    ];

    /// Get indexes of active protection for a lending pool from the storage
    EnumerableSetUpgradeable.UintSet
      storage activeProtectionIndexes = lendingPoolDetail //@audit get active protection indexes without updating
        .activeProtectionIndexes;

    /// Iterate all active protections and calculate total locked amount for this lending pool
    /// 1. calculate remaining principal amount for each loan protection in the lending pool.
    /// 2. for each loan protection, lockedAmt = min(protectionAmt, remainingPrincipal)
    /// 3. total locked amount = sum of lockedAmt for all loan protections
    uint256 _length = activeProtectionIndexes.length();
    for (uint256 i; i < _length; ) {
      /// Get protection info from the storage
      uint256 _protectionIndex = activeProtectionIndexes.at(i);
      ...
```

But `lockCapital()` uses the current `activeProtectionIndexes` without checking the already expired protections after the last `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` and it will bring unfair loss for sellers.

## Impact
Already expired protections might be locked by `lockCapital()` and sellers might suffer unfair losses if the lending pool defaulted.

## Recommendation
I think it would be good to call `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` first in `lockCapital()` to work with the up-to-date protections.
