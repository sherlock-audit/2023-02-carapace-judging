# a secondary market for sTokens is dangerous with how withdrawals work

## Summary
Using a secondary market like uniswap a user can use flash loans to take shares of interest without taking any of the risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

From the [docs](https://www.carapace.finance/WhitePaper#yields-distribution:~:text=If%20sellers%20wish,for%20protection%20sellers.):
> If sellers wish to redeem their capital and interest before the lockup period, they might be able to find a buyer of their sToken in a secondary market like Uniswap. Traders in the exchanges can long/short sTokens based on their opinion about the risk exposure associated with sTokens. Since an sToken is a fungible ERC20 token, it is fairly easy to bootstrap the secondary markets for protection sellers.

This is problematic because sTokens don't accrue linearly. They accrue at predicable points in time (when a borrower repays). The accrual can be triggered by anyone so if you could deposit, accrue and withdraw in the same transaction this could be abused.

To do this you need to be able to deposit and withdraw in the same tx, which the protocol prohibits. However this can be done by registering a withdraw with a flash loan two cycles earlier. Since the `requestWithdrawal` only requires you to hold the sTokens while calling it:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1061-L1065
```solidity
File: ProtectionPool.sol

1061:  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
1062:    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
1063:    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
1064:      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
1065:    }
```

So the attack proceeds as follows:

### Period 1
flash loan sToken to register withdrawal

### Period 3
1. flash loan USDC, either as much as can fit under leverage ceiling or up to your sToken withdrawal limit
2. deposit
2. accrue
3. withdraw

This can be repeated once per cycle per account and the only risk you take is the flash loan fees.

## Impact
Using a secondary market an attacker can bypass the withdrawal duration lock and steal interest shares from normal sToken holders. Since they never hold sTokens the attacker will never be taking any risk apart from initial flash loan fee.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend that the seller when registering a withdrawal also hand over the sTokens to the ProtectionPool. If they don't want to go through with the withdrawal the protocol can add a call where they can claim the sTokens back.

If they go through with the withdrawal the tokens can be burnt from the `ProtectionPool` contract instead and do the same book keeping that is already done.

This fix will mess up the snapshots for claiming unlocked funds though, so a record of who locked sTokens for withdrawal at what snapshot would need to be kept.
