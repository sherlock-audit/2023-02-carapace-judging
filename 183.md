# Lenders are able to purchase protection in excess of their lending position

## Summary

The code in many places supports buyers buying multiple protections, including on the same lending pool. However, by doing so, they can buy an arbitrary amount of protection on their position, so long as the leverage ratio supports it.

## Vulnerability Detail

The check to see how much protection a buyer can purchase on a pool bottoms out in GoldFinchAdapter.calculateRemainingPrincipal, particularly this expression.

```solidity
        _principalRemaining =
          _tokenInfo.principalAmount -
          _tokenInfo.principalRedeemed;
```

Note that this formula does not take into account the amount of protection someone has already bought on their position.

Therefore, they can buy multiple protections on the same position which sum to vastly greater than their principal.

## Impact

This means that someone can contribute $1000 to a lending pool, buy $1,000,000 of protection (in, say, 2000 different protection positions each worth $500), somehow induce the borrower to default or otherwise block payment (perhaps by DOSing the underlying lending pool), and then 1000x their money.

## Recommendation

Subtract the amount of protection a buyer has already purchased from their remaining principal when evaluating whether they can buy, or bar a buyer from buying multiple protections on a single lending pool.
