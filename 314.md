# User not charged for grace period

## Summary

Protection buyer is not charged retrospectively for the grace period, while still effectively protected. This leads to loss of yields for sellers.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `ProtectionPool.renewProtection` uses the current `block.timestamp` to create a new protection:

```js
//ProtectionPoolHelper.verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection(...)

_verifyAndCreateProtection(
    block.timestamp,
    _protectionPurchaseParams,
    _maxPremiumAmount,
    true
);
```

This incentivices protection buyers to wait until the end of the grace period to renew their subscriptions, because they dont have to pay during that time. In case buyers see a default impending, they can still renew just in time and are effectively protected during the grace period this way.

## Impact

Loss of yields/evasion of fees

## Recommendation

Replace `block.timestamp` in the snippet above with the endtimestamp of the last protection plus one second.
