# sToken can be inflated because the balanceOf function does not specify the token used

## Summary

sToken can be inflated because the balanceOf function does not specify the token used.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a seller wants to withdraw deposit and convert sToken back to underlying tokens, the function `_requestWithdrawal()` is called. The function checks the balance of the seller and makes sure the sTokenAmount requested to withdraw is more than the sTokenBalance that the seller has. The problem comes when the balance of the msg.sender is not specified.

```solidity
  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
```

There can be many instances of tokens in the seller's account, seller can arbitrarily inflate his sToken. Also, sToken is used in other ProtectionPools which may cause confusion.

## Impact

The sToken balance is not checked properly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend specifying which token the balanceOf function is referring to.

```solidity
  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = ERC20(sToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);
```
