# a protection seller can deposit and withdraw in the same cycle

## Summary
A protection seller only need to stake their funds during the two first cycles after that they can deposit and withdraw in the same cycle.

## Vulnerability Detail
To do a withdrawal you need to register two cycles in advance that you aim to do a withdrawal. Then after two cycles you can withdraw once the pool reaches the Open state. This protects protection buyers against sellers withdrawing right before funds are locked and defaulted.

However, if you look at the code that registers the withdrawal:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1061-L1094
```solidity
File: ProtectionPool.sol

1061:  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
1062:    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
1063:    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
1064:      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
1065:    }
```

It only checks that you have the sTokens at the time of registering the withdrawal. A seller could each cycle register a withdrawal. Then after two cycles have passed. They can withdraw: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L233-L245
```solidity
File: ProtectionPool.sol

226:  function withdraw(uint256 _sTokenWithdrawalAmount, address _receiver)
227:    external
228:    override
229:    whenPoolIsOpen
230:    whenNotPaused
231:    nonReentrant
232:  {
233:    /// Step 1: Retrieve withdrawal details for current pool cycle index
234:    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
235:      address(this)
236:    );
237:    WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
238:      _currentCycleIndex
239:    ];

...

257:    /// Step 5: burn sTokens shares.
258:    /// This step must be done after calculating underlying amount to be transferred
259:    _burn(msg.sender, _sTokenWithdrawalAmount);
260:
261:    /// Step 6: Update total sToken underlying amount
262:    totalSTokenUnderlying -= _underlyingAmountToTransfer;
263:
264:    /// Step 7: update seller's withdrawal amount and total requested withdrawal amount
265:    withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender] -= _sTokenWithdrawalAmount;
266:    withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested -= _sTokenWithdrawalAmount;
```

Since they have withdrawals registered for the two following cycles they can deposit and withdraw in the same cycle. The seller can continue to register a new withdrawal each cycle and can continue forever.

## Impact
As long as a seller stakes their funds for at least two cycles they can withdraw anytime they want in any open cycle. Thus reducing the risk they take. They can only withdraw once per cycle but that is enough to evade a locking of funds and maximize interest gained.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend that the seller when registering a withdrawal also hand over the sTokens to the ProtectionPool. If they don't want to go through with the withdrawal the protocol can add a call where they can claim the sTokens back.

If they go through with the withdrawal the tokens can be burnt from the `ProtectionPool` contract instead and do the same book keeping that is already done.

This fix will mess up the snapshots for claiming unlocked funds though, so a record of who locked sTokens for withdrawal at what snapshot would need to be kept.
