# First depositor can manipulate the pool shares

## Summary
The first depositor can manipulate the pool shares
## Vulnerability Detail
`ProtectionPool` contract's `convertToSToken` function converts the given underlying amount to SToken shares/amount and returns the shares scaled to 18 decimals.
The function validates whether the depositor is the first depositor by checking the `totalSupply()`. If the depositor is the first one to deposit, the function assigns the same amount of `_underlyingAmount` as shares and the same amount is minted to the first depositor. And if the pools have tokens before, the share calculation is made by dividing the `_underlyingAmount` by to exchange rate which is `_totalScaledCapital` divided by `_totalSTokenSupply`.

The problem is, if the first deposit is a  super high value, the depositor/attacker can cause all future depositors to lose a significant portion of their deposits to the attacker due to precision loss.


## Impact
Loss of user funds

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function convertToSToken(uint256 _underlyingAmount)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    uint256 _scaledUnderlyingAmt = ProtectionPoolHelper
      .scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
        _underlyingAmount,
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );

    /// if there are no sTokens in the pool, return the underlying amount
    if (totalSupply() == 0) return _scaledUnderlyingAmt;

    return
      (_scaledUnderlyingAmt * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _getExchangeRate();
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send part of the initial mints as a permanent reserve to the DAO/treasury/deployer so that the `_sTokenShares` can be more resistant to manipulation.
Or, do not permit to mint zero shares by a require statement.
