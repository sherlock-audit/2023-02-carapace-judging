# Various `initialize` functions can be frontrun

## Summary

Various `initialize` functions can be frontrun

## Vulnerability Detail

As per the deploy scripts, various contracts which have `initialize` functions are first deployed then initialized later.

There is therefore a risk that a malicious attacker could monitor the mempool for bytecode of the deployed contracts and frontrun the initializations.

In some cases such as the `ProtectionPool` and `ReferenceLendingPools`, `_transferOwnership` is done in the `initialize` function meaning the attacker would take ownership.

## Impact

Denial of service is the most likely outcome.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure the `initialize()` functions are only callable by an authorized address.
