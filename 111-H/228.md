# Handling of pool cycle state by daily cron is flawed

## Summary

Handling of pool cycle state by daily cron is flawed

## Vulnerability Detail

Having `ProtectionPoolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` be run by a cron daily fails to account for protocol requirements.

`calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` just relies on timestamps to change cycle state irrespective of other factors such as defaults and late payments.

## Impact

This can break protocol operation and lead to various bugs as cycle state will change without checking if it is safe to do so.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Have the cycle times be changed at contract level based on various checks.
