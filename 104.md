# deposit function for protection seller validation logic in Protection.sol does not match the documentation

## Summary

Incorrect implementation of the deposit function for protection seller in ProtectionPool.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

When the deposit in ProtectionPool.sol is called, which calls

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IProtectionPool
function deposit(uint256 _underlyingAmount, address _receiver)
  external
  override
  whenNotPaused
  nonReentrant
{
  _deposit(_underlyingAmount, _receiver);
}
```

which calls:

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Deposits the specified amount of underlying token to the pool and
   * mints the corresponding sToken shares to the receiver.
   * @param _underlyingAmount the amount of underlying token to deposit
   * @param _receiver the address to receive the sToken shares
   */
  function _deposit(uint256 _underlyingAmount, address _receiver) internal {
    /// Verify that the pool is not in OpenToBuyers phase
    if (poolInfo.currentPhase == ProtectionPoolPhase.OpenToBuyers) {
      revert ProtectionPoolInOpenToBuyersPhase();
    }

    uint256 _sTokenShares = convertToSToken(_underlyingAmount);
    totalSTokenUnderlying += _underlyingAmount;
    _safeMint(_receiver, _sTokenShares);
    poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
      msg.sender,
      address(this),
      _underlyingAmount
    );

    /// Verify leverage ratio only when total capital/sTokenUnderlying is higher than minimum capital requirement
    if (_hasMinRequiredCapital()) {
      /// calculate pool's current leverage ratio considering the new deposit
      uint256 _leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();

      if (_leverageRatio > poolInfo.params.leverageRatioCeiling) {
        revert ProtectionPoolLeverageRatioTooHigh(_leverageRatio);
      }
    }

    emit ProtectionSold(_receiver, _underlyingAmount);
  }
```

note the validation check:

```solidity
    /// Verify leverage ratio only when total capital/sTokenUnderlying is higher than minimum capital requirement
    if (_hasMinRequiredCapital()) {
      /// calculate pool's current leverage ratio considering the new deposit
      uint256 _leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();

      if (_leverageRatio > poolInfo.params.leverageRatioCeiling) {
        revert ProtectionPoolLeverageRatioTooHigh(_leverageRatio);
      }
    }
```

However, according to the documentation of the protection sellers:

https://www.carapace.finance/docs/protocol-mechanics/protection_sellers#conditions-for-deposit

> A seller can make a deposit at any time as long as the follow conditions are met:

> If the total capital in the pool is less than the minimum capital in a pool OR
> If the leverage ratio is less than the leverage ratio ceiling after the transaction

The implementation does not match the documentation at all, the implementation verifies leverage ratio only when total capital/sTokenUnderlying is higher than minimum capital requirement instead of implements the "OR" check specified in the documentation.

## Impact

Implementation does not match the documentation, the seller cannot deposit into the pool when

> the total capital in the pool is less than the minimum capital in a pool OR
> If the leverage ratio is less than the leverage ratio ceiling after the transaction

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol make the implementation matches the specification of the documentation.
