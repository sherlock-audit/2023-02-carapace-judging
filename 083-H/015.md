# Malicious user can manipulate premeium price before buy protection

## Summary
Malicious user can create fake withdraw requests for different accounts in a specific cycle , this gives the user ability to deposit and withdraw in that same cycle with different accounts and sandwich buyProtection between deposits and withdraws in one cycle or even transaction if user be a smart contract . This cause to manipulate premium price before buy protection and buy protection even if it breaches the leverage ratio floor .
## Vulnerability Detail
to withdraw funds user needs to request withdraw two cycles before actual withdraw so she/he won't be able to deposit and withdraw funds in same cycle but user can deposit an amount and request withdraw then transfer SToken to another account and request withdraw again and repeat this process and creates fake withdraw requests for different accounts that have no funds deposited in the pool which enable them to deposit and withdraw funds both in that same cycle 
```solidity
function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }

    /// Get current cycle index for this pool
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );

    /// Actual withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle after next cycle
    /// For example: if request is made in at some time in cycle 1,
    /// then withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 3
    uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;

    WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
      _withdrawalCycleIndex
    ];

    /// Cache existing requested amount for the cycle for the sender
    uint256 _oldRequestAmount = withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender];
    withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender] = _sTokenAmount;

    unchecked {
      /// Update total requested withdrawal amount for the cycle considering existing requested amount
      if (_oldRequestAmount > _sTokenAmount) {
        withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested -= (_oldRequestAmount -
          _sTokenAmount);
      } else {
        withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested += (_sTokenAmount -
          _oldRequestAmount);
      }
    }

    emit WithdrawalRequested(msg.sender, _sTokenAmount, _withdrawalCycleIndex);
  }
```
when the cycle arrives the accounts have withdraw request registered even if they don't have any funds deposited so they can deposit and withdraw funds as much as request registered in that cycle . if a user be able to deposit and withdraw in same cycle can sandwich buyProtection : first depositing and moving leverage ratio higher up to leverage ratio ceiling which makes premium price lower and then buy protection with low premium price then withdraw their funds and also possibly it will move leverage ratio under floor . 
beside that user can use this to manipulate premium price it can be used to by protection that breaches leverage ratio floor . 
also if user has not enough funds to deposit and manipulate price he/she can use flashloan due that all of this can happen in one transaction . 
## Impact
manipulate leverage ratio and premium price before buy protection 
buy protection that breaches leverage ratio floor 
user can deposit and withdraw in same cycle

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can consider lock STokens when a user requests to withdraw this ensures user won't be able to transfer tokens to others and create fake withdraw requests .
