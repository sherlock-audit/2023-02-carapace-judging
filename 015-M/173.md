# When purchasing a protection, `_verifyLendingPoolIsActive` processes data based on an outdated version of `defaultStateManager`

## Summary
When a user wants to purchase a protection, the `_verifyLendingPoolIsActive` function inside the `ProtectionPoolHelper` does the processing on outdated data taken from `defaultStateManager`. This can allow protections to not get verified correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a protection buyer wants to buy a protection, it should be checked by the protocol that the underlying `lendingPool` is active and not in `late` state. However, `defaultStateManager` can get out of sync with the actual underlying pools if the state is not assessed in time, therefore, whenever the data is to be processed, the `assessState` should be called on the `protectionPool`. In this case, there is no `assessState` called and therefore, users can buy protections based on outdated data.

## Impact
Malicious users can wait until the last second, while the underlying pool is still in the `late` state but the `defaultStatemanager` is not updated yet, to purchase the protection when they think the position will default with a higher probability.

## Recommendation
`assessState` function inside the `defaultStateManager` should be called before purchasing a protection.
