# buy protection doesn't assesses LendingPools status before verifyProtection

## Summary
verifyProtection checks status of lending pools and verifies that they are active before buy protection , but it doesn't call _assessState function to assess and update lending pool status . may from last time of assessment a lending pool status has been changed and is not active but still set as active in DefaultStateManager , In this case user can buy protection even if lending pool is not active . 
## Vulnerability Detail
verifyProtection uses _verifyLendingPoolIsActive to ensure lending pool is active , if not active , it reverts the transaction and doesn't allow to buy protection but may from last _assessState function call that updates lending pool status , status have been changed to late or ... and is not active anymore so _assessStatefunction in DefaultStateManager must be called before _verifyLendingPoolIsActive during buy protection process to update lending pools status and ensure status is updated and correct  . 
## Impact
user can buy protection even if lending pool is not active .
