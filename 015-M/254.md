# Frontrun monitoring program to be able to purchase protection for locked pools

## Summary
The protocol relies on ```_assessState()``` to update the status of ```poolState.lendingPoolStateDetails[_lendingPool]```. This function however does not automatically update every time the user ```buyProtection()``` so malicious user may be able to front run off-chain monitoring program to ```buyProtection()``` as soon as he detects that there is a missed payment in lending pools. Moreover there may be a large gap before the monitoring program updates the state of pool because it is documented that it will only ```assessState()``` daily. If there is a late payment just a few minutes after the pool is assessed, if no one updates the state in place of the program, then there will be a gap of almost 24 hours that malicious buyer will be able to take advantage of. 

## Vulnerability Detail
1.Assuming the monitoring program updates ```poolState``` every 12:00 am

2.In the next hour, there is a missed payment in one of the pools 

3.Users will still be able to ```buyProtection()``` even though there is a verifying function ```   _verifyLendingPoolIsActive``` to check ```poolState``` because this function will call ```defaultStateManager.getLendingPoolStatus()``` which pull non-updated status of the pool as shown in the link

4.The pool will be locked in the next day when the monitoring program returns to ```assessState()``` the pools


## Impact
This will cause an asymmetrical situation where the buyer has an advantage over sellers because he will only purchase if the payment is missed, increasing his chance of getting a payout

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I donâ€™t think that making off-chain monitoring program that automatically detects the pool state everytime there is a major change in pool status would be helpful because a malicious buyer would still be able to front-run the monitoring program. 
I think it is best to ```assessState()``` everytime there is a ```buyProtection()``` called to ensure that pool status will be updated when the buy happens.
