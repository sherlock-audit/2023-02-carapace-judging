# Protections can be bought when the state of the pool is supposed to be in-active.

## Summary

During the first 90 days and when buyers have the ability to renew they could in some circumstance buy a protection even if the lender pool should be locked. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`assessState()` is called on a daily basis but not directly after a payment is missed a user with a loan could buy a protection when a protection is supposed to have changed from Active -> LateWitGracePeriod but is not yet changed since `assessState()` has not been called yet. 

During the first 90 days and whenever a loan is expired but in a grace period buyers are able to buy protection even if the lending pool is supposed to be locked if `assessState()` has not been called yet.

Currently the `_verifyLendingPoolIsActive()` function calls `getLendingPoolStatus()` in the DefaultManager which checks the status in the `protectionPoolState` array. This is only updated when `assessState()` is called. 

## Impact

Buyer can buy protection in lendingpools that are late i.e `ITranchedPool(_lendingPoolAddress).creditLine().isLate == true` IN some circumstances. This means that they are able to buy a protection when the lendingpool is locked and is at risk of a default. This  would increase the default rate that seller have to pay. It is also increasing the risk of insolvency for other protection buyers since more funds than expected are insured. 

## Code Snippet
Check of state, does not check with the actual pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review, vscode, foundry

## Recommendation

When depositing there should exist a check that makes sure that the lendingpool is not late. This is could be done by making the `_getLendingPoolStatus()` in the ReferenceLendingPool a public function that can be called in `_verifyAndCreateProtection()` and checked if it is active.
