# Inaccurate sToken amount increase on ProtectionPool deposit results in higher leverage ratio and last protection seller losing funds on withdraw

## Summary
The function `ProtectionPool._deposit`, but in general the protocol, does not consider if the underlying token does  apply a fee on transfers. And so the sToken generated and the storage variable `totalSTokenUnderlying` will have inaccurate values resulting in a slightly increase on the leverage ratio and a loss of funds for the protection seller that will withdraw as the last one.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1035-L1042 , the protocol does not consider a token which applies fee-on-transfer resulting in  `totalSTokenUnderlying` and sToken amount greater than they actually should be, because as stated on the whitepaper: "the sTokens minted and sTokens burned will be proportional to the deposited or withdrawn amount".

As consequence, the protection seller calling as the last one the function `ProtectionPool.withdraw` will receive an amount of  the underlying token + premium which will be slightly below than how it should be, this is because the previous protection sellers will withdraw more than they should because the burned value was not considered when `totalSTokenUnderlying` was incremented. Also if `_underlyingAmountToTransfer` is equal to `totalSTokenUnderlying`, then the transfer on the last protection seller will revert https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L272 .

## Impact
Loss of funds, possible DoS, requirements != specifications.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Tokens using fee-on-transfer solution should be considered. A solution could be to add a hook point on `ProtectionPool._deposit` which will be declared only by a inherited class, (e.g. 'ProtectionPoolWithFee`), and so the variable `totalSTokenUnderlying` will be updated before doing the `_safeMint`.
