# _adapter.isLendingPoolLateWithinGracePeriod lending status estimation is not accurate, setting Constants.LATE_PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_IN_DAYS to 1 day is too short.

## Summary

_adapter.isLendingPoolLateWithinGracePeriod check has issue

## Vulnerability Detail

If the current implementation, the lending pool status is a crucial component because the code use the lending pool to determine if buyer and seller can buy protection / deposit fund / lock seller's fund.

Please look at the code below:

```solidity
if (
  _adapter.isLendingPoolLateWithinGracePeriod(
    _lendingPoolAddress,
    Constants.LATE_PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_IN_DAYS
  )
) {
  return LendingPoolStatus.LateWithinGracePeriod;
}
```

the code attempts to check if a lending pool's late payment is within the grace period, which calls:

```solidity
  /// @inheritdoc ILendingProtocolAdapter
  function isLendingPoolLateWithinGracePeriod(
    address _lendingPoolAddress,
    uint256 _gracePeriodInDays
  ) external view override returns (bool) {
    uint256 _lastPaymentTimestamp = _getLatestPaymentTimestamp(
      _lendingPoolAddress
    );

    /// Lending pool is considered late but within grace period if:
    /// 1. Lending pool is late and
    /// 2. Current time is less than the last payment time plus the payment period plus the grace period
    return
      _isLendingPoolLate(_lendingPoolAddress) &&
      block.timestamp <=
      (_lastPaymentTimestamp +
        ((_getCreditLine(_lendingPoolAddress).paymentPeriodInDays() +
          _gracePeriodInDays) * Constants.SECONDS_IN_DAY_UINT));
  }
```

the Constants.LATE_PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_IN_DAYS is hardcoded to 1 days, meaning that within one day after the payment is missed, the payment is considered late, however, the 1 days grace period is too short.

Given that the cycle of in the Carapace period is 90 days, and 

According to https://docs.goldfinch.finance/goldfinch/protocol-mechanics/default-process

> When a Borrower misses an interest payment date, defined by their off-chain agreement, or breaks any other provision in their off-chain agreement: 

> Off-chain: Borrower enters a 3-7 (exact dates vary by pool according to what investors negotiated for) grace period to remediate the missed payment, or broken provision. 

> On-chain: Borrower enters a 45 day grace period before the protocol marks the loan on-chain as being in default, and starts provisioning the loan.

we can clearly see that the grace period is as long as 45 days instead of hardcoded 1 days in the codebase.

## Impact

The Constants.LATE_PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_IN_DAYS is too short and not consistent with the GoldFinch protocol's parameter setting, leading to too short grace period estimation.

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol adjust the grace period setting to make sure the grace period status check and derivation matches goldfinch's protocol's lending pool status and parameter.
