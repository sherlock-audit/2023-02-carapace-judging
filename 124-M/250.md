# Repaid lending pool should distribute premium to protection sellers

## Summary
Repaid lending pool should distribute premium to protection sellers
## Vulnerability Detail
Lending pool can become expired which can mean that `_creditLine.termEndTime()` has passed or `_creditLine.balance() == 0` which means that lending pool debt is repaid.

```solidity
  function isLendingPoolExpired(address _lendingPoolAddress)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (bool)
  {
    ICreditLine _creditLine = _getCreditLine(_lendingPoolAddress);
    uint256 _termEndTimestamp = _creditLine.termEndTime();


    /// Repaid logic derived from Goldfinch frontend code:
    /// https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/bd9adae6fbd810d1ebb5f7ef22df5bb6f1eaee3b/packages/client2/lib/pools/index.ts#L54
    /// when the credit line has zero balance with valid term end, it is considered repaid
    return
      block.timestamp >= _termEndTimestamp ||
      (_termEndTimestamp > 0 && _creditLine.balance() == 0);
  }
```

In case if pool is expired that means that protection has finished for protection buyers of that lending pool.
It's possible that borrower will repay lending pool earlier than end timestamp, in this case premium for that lending pool should be distributed to the protection sellers.
Currently nothing will happen and protection sellers will wait until end of each protection for that lending pool.
## Impact
Protection sellers do not receive payment for protection, once protection is over.

## Recommendation
Once lending pool is repaid, then pay all remaining premium to the protection sellers.
