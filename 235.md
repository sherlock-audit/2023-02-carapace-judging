# deposit of ProtectionPool should use the whenPoolIsOpen modifier

## Summary
The deposit and depositAndRequestWithdrawal functions inside of ProtectionPool should use the whenPoolIsOpen modifier.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/// @notice Represents various states of a pool cycle.
enum ProtectionPoolCycleState {
  None, // The cycle state for unregistered pools.
  Open, // The cycle is open for deposit & withdraw
  Locked // The cycle is in progress & locked for deposit & withdraw
}
```
If we look at the enum ProtectionPoolCycleState, it says clearly that if the PoolCycleState is Locked, it should not be the possibility to deposit funds.
```solidity
/// @notice Checks whether pool cycle is in open state. If not, reverts.
  /// @dev This modifier is used to restrict certain functions to be called only during the open period of a pool cycle.
  /// @dev This modifier also updates the pool cycle state before verifying the state.
  modifier whenPoolIsOpen() {...}
```
All functions that should be restricted when the pool is locked, use the whenPoolIsOpen modifier inside of ProtectionPool.
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 _underlyingAmount, address _receiver)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
  {...}
```
Right now the only function that uses the modifier is the withdraw function.

## Impact
The documentation on https://www.carapace.finance/WhitePaper doesn't mention if this is intended or not, so the error could just be a information mismatch (the comment is wrong), but if the protocol design intends to lock deposits when the pool is locked this breaks the design.

## Recommendation
Add whenPoolIsOpen modifier to the desired functions (deposit/depositAndRequestWithdrawal), or update the comment.
