# Malicious seller can withdraw at same cycle what deposit

jesusrod15
## Summary
a malicious seller can inflate their request Withdrawal with help another user, 
transferring their STokens and create a request Withdrawal with amount 
that no have deposit then transfer  Stokens back to user, then in a phase 
OpenToSellers 2 cycles later can deposit amount of requets Withdrawal, 
wait  ProtectionPoolPhase.Open and withdraw getting gains 

PoC
we assume  phase OpenToSellers  cycle 1
1) user 1 deposit 100,000 usdc obtaining  10,000 Stokens
2) user 2 deposit 50,000 usdc obtaining   50,000 Stokens
3) user 2 transfer STokens to user 3 
4) user 3 request Withdrawal() for same value and transfer  STokens back to user2
5) cycle 3 OpenToSellers
6) user 3 deposit 50,000 usdc
7) ProtectionPoolPhase.Open in cycle3
8) user 3 withdraw in cycle3 

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1062

due a that  _sTokenBalance is set with balanceOf there is no way know if those tokens was deposit  by user at these cycle

## Impact
the gains of user 3 can variate depending of others user but the important thing is in how it break that rule the not withdraw at same cycle of deposit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
could add a a mapping in _deposit that catch deposit for cycles and then evaluate at moment of withdraw
