# The ````New Protection Rule```` can be bypassed

## Summary
There is a ````New Protection Rule```` for buyers which is due to
https://www.carapace.finance/docs/protocol-mechanics/protection_buyers
```solidity
A buyer can only buy new protection within 90 days after a lending pool is added to our pool. 
After that point, they will not be able to purchase protection.
Existing lenders cannot buy protection anytime they want.
Otherwise, they would buy protection right before the missed payment. 
Since credit default swaps exist to deal with uncertainty, 
we cannot allow them to buy when they are certain that a borrower is gonna default.
```
But the rule can actually be bypassed due to miss check on the ````protectionAmount````.


## Vulnerability Detail
As shown by the ````verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection()```` which is specifically designed for renew checking, it only checks if there is existing previous buy on the specified ````lendingPoolAddress.nftLpTokenId```` and with in allowed renew time range.
```solidity
File: contracts\libraries\ProtectionPoolHelper.sol
360:   function verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection(
361:     mapping(address => ProtectionBuyerAccount) storage protectionBuyerAccounts,
362:     ProtectionInfo[] storage protectionInfos,
363:     ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
364:     uint256 _renewalGracePeriodInSeconds
365:   ) external view {
366:     uint256 _renewalProtectionIndex = protectionBuyerAccounts[msg.sender]
367:       .expiredProtectionIndexByLendingPool[
368:         _protectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress
369:       ][_protectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId];
370: 
371:     if (_renewalProtectionIndex == 0) {
372:       revert IProtectionPool.NoExpiredProtectionToRenew();
373:     }
374: 
375:     ProtectionInfo storage expiredProtectionInfo = protectionInfos[
376:       _renewalProtectionIndex
377:     ];
378:     ProtectionPurchaseParams
379:       storage expiredProtectionPurchaseParams = expiredProtectionInfo
380:         .purchaseParams;
381: 
382:     /// This means a buyer has expired protection for the same lending position
383:     if (
384:       expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress ==
385:       _protectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress &&
386:       expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId ==
387:       _protectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
388:     ) {
389:       /// If we are NOT within grace period after the protection is expired, then revert
390:       if (
391:         block.timestamp >
392:         (expiredProtectionInfo.startTimestamp +
393:           expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.protectionDurationInSeconds +
394:           _renewalGracePeriodInSeconds)
395:       ) {
396:         revert IProtectionPool.CanNotRenewProtectionAfterGracePeriod();
397:       }
398:     }
399:   }

```
But miss to check the ````protectionAmount````, buyers can buy and renew protection with ````protectionAmount```` like this
```solidity
cycle 1 => 1 USDC
cycle 2 => 1 USDC
cycle 3 => 1 USDC
// the risk of default becomes high
cycle 4 => 100,000 USDC
cycle ... // adjust before every cycle, only pay premium while the risk become high
```

## Impact
The ````New Protection Rule```` can actually be bypassed.

## Recommendation
Make sure the ````protectionAmount```` of renew can not be greater than previous amount.
