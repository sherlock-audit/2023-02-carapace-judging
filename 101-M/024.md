# A lender can buy protections even in the open phase.

## Summary
A lender is supposed to buy protections on in the ``OpenToSellers`` phase. However, current implementation allows a lender to buy protections even in the ``Open`` phase. 


## Vulnerability Detail


## Impact
A lender can buy even in the ``Open`` phase because the lender can pass the check at L1031-L1033 since ``OpenToBuyers != Open``. As a result, a lender will be able to successfully buy protections even in the ``Open`` phase.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the condition so that a lender can only buy protections during the ``OpenToSellers`` phase. 
```diff
 function _deposit(uint256 _underlyingAmount, address _receiver) internal {
    /// Verify that the pool is not in OpenToBuyers phase
-    if (poolInfo.currentPhase == ProtectionPoolPhase.OpenToBuyers) {
-      revert ProtectionPoolInOpenToBuyersPhase();
-    }
+    if (poolInfo.currentPhase != ProtectionPoolPhase.OpenToSellers) {
+     revert ProtectionPoolNotInOpenToSellerPhase();
+   }
 

    uint256 _sTokenShares = convertToSToken(_underlyingAmount);
    totalSTokenUnderlying += _underlyingAmount;
    _safeMint(_receiver, _sTokenShares);
    poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
      msg.sender,
      address(this),
      _underlyingAmount
    );

    /// Verify leverage ratio only when total capital/sTokenUnderlying is higher than minimum capital requirement
    if (_hasMinRequiredCapital()) {
      /// calculate pool's current leverage ratio considering the new deposit
      uint256 _leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();

      if (_leverageRatio > poolInfo.params.leverageRatioCeiling) {
        revert ProtectionPoolLeverageRatioTooHigh(_leverageRatio);
      }
    }

    emit ProtectionSold(_receiver, _underlyingAmount);
  }
```
