# A malicious early seller can manipulate sToken price and profit from future seller deposits

## Summary

A malicious early seller can manipulate `sToken` price and profit from future seller deposits

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious early seller can deposit 1 wei of `_underlyingAmount` as the first depositor and get 1 wei share of `sToken`.
The seller can then send a large number of `_underlyingAmount` and inflate the price per share to a very high amount.

Future sellers who make deposits will receive very few shares of `sToken` due to the manipulation.
The malicious seller will also be able to withdraw inflated amounts for very few shares of `sToken`

```solidity
  function convertToSToken(uint256 _underlyingAmount)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    uint256 _scaledUnderlyingAmt = ProtectionPoolHelper
      .scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
        _underlyingAmount,
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );

    /// if there are no sTokens in the pool, return the underlying amount
    if (totalSupply() == 0) return _scaledUnderlyingAmt;

    return
      (_scaledUnderlyingAmt * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _getExchangeRate();
  }
```

## Impact

Loss of funds as the malicious seller will profit off other future sellers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimum amount of `sToken` to be minted for the first depositor. Alternatively premint sTokens for the protocol before the first deposit.
