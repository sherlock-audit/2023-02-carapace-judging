# Consecutive lockings cause capital to be lost forever

## Summary

If capital is locked and then unlocked multiple times before a seller tries to claim, then they will only be able to claim their share of capital from the most-recently-unlocked LockedCapital. Their share from the previous LockedCapital's will be stuck in the pool forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is the body of the loop in DefaultStateManager._calculateClaimableAmount (logs removed):

```solidity
      /// Verify that the seller does not claim the same snapshot twice
      if (!lockedCapital.locked && _snapshotId > _lastClaimedSnapshotId) {
        ERC20SnapshotUpgradeable _poolSToken = ERC20SnapshotUpgradeable(
          address(poolState.protectionPool)
        );

        /// The claimable amount for the given seller is proportional to the seller's share of the total supply at the snapshot
        /// claimable amount = (seller's snapshot balance / total supply at snapshot) * locked capital amount
        _claimableUnlockedCapital =
          (_poolSToken.balanceOfAt(_seller, _snapshotId) *
            lockedCapital.amount) /
          _poolSToken.totalSupplyAt(_snapshotId);

        /// Update the last claimed snapshot id for the seller
        _latestClaimedSnapshotId = _snapshotId;
      }
```

The problem is the line `claimableUnlockedCapital = ...`. This should be a +=, not an =. Because of that, this line overrides any unlocked capital that should be claimable from previous LockedCapital's in previous iterations of the loop. The update to _latestClaimedSnapshotId ensures that previous LockedCapital's can never be accessed by this seller again.

## Impact

Sellers who don't claim their unlocked funds on time can lose them forever.
