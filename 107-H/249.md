# Protections that haven't started yet are paid, causing loss of funds to protection sellers

## Summary
When a pool is late, all protections bought for the pool receive compensations from protection sellers, including protections that haven't started yet. As a results, protection sellers overpay for protections and lose a portion of their funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a lending pool is late on a payment, all protections bought for the pool are subject to payouts. Pools with late payments are identified by the [assessStates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L119) function, which is called on schedule. When a pool transitions from `Active` or `LateWithinGracePeriod` state to `Late` state, a portion of funds is [locked to pay protections](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L397-L399). To find the amount of funds to lock, [all active protections are iterated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L373-L386) and the sum of all protection amounts is calculated.

An active protection is a protection that:
1. was bought or renewed: buying or renewing protections [adds protection index to the list of active protections of the lending pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L887);
1. haven't expired: after a protection has expired, [its index is removed from the list of lending pool's active protections](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L302-L308).

When buying or renewing a protection, the buyer can [specify the start time of the protection](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L876), which allows protections that start in the future. However, such protections are immediately [added to the list of active protections](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L884-L890) and [counted when calculating the amount of funds to lock to compensate a late payment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L385-L386). Thus, buyers of future protections can receive compensation while their protections are not active, even though [future protections don't accrue premium](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L232).
## Impact
Protection sellers are forced to pay out protections that haven't started yet, causing extra spending on them. Since future protections don't accrue premium, protection sellers basically lose funds paying such protections.

The vulnerability can be exploited intentionally by protection buyers. For example, buyers can buy only protections with the minimal duration that start in the future and end right at the next cycle end's timestamp. In case any other protections defaults before such protections, the buyers will be compensated, due to the failed active protection check. If a pool defaults during the timestamp of a future protection, protection buyers will be paid again, which basically means double spending for protection sellers.
## Code Snippet
1. Protections are created and added to the list of active protections even when they start in the future:
[ProtectionPool.sol#L871-L890](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L871-L890)
1. Protections are removed from the list of active protections only when they expire:
[ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L302-L308](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L302-L308)
1. When locking funds to pay protections in a defaulted pool, all active protections are counted, including future ones:
[ProtectionPool.sol#L373-L386](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L373-L386)
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider excluding future protections in the `lockCapital` function to avoid paying out protections that haven't started yet.
