# Bypass the deposit lock time rule and take risk free premium

## Summary
There is a ````deposit lock time rule```` for sellers which is to prevent sellers from running away when a default event happens. 
https://www.carapace.finance/docs/protocol-mechanics/protection_sellers#request-for-withdrawal
```solidity
Each seller must lock their capital for at least one cycle plus the remaining days in the current cycle from the point 
where a request is made. Since the cycle duration is 90 days, 
if you deposit on day 80 and immediately request to withdraw, 
you need to lock up for 10 days plus another 90 days. 
This system prevents sellers from running away when a default event happens. 
```
But it can be bypassed due to miss updating withdrawal requests while ````sToken```` is transferred.
Sellers can exploit it to take risk free premium from the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
As review of the whole ````ProtectionPool```` contract, we can see it doesn't override the ````_beforeTokenTransfer()```` function of ````sToken````, which is  inherited from ````ERC20SnapshotUpgradeable```` . Hence, withdrawal requests will not be updated while ````sToken```` is transferred.
Next, let's show how to exploit it 
Given
```solidity
 The attacker has 100K USDC on his main account (A0)
```
1. Attacker prepare another 100 accounts, A1, A2, ..., A100
2. At circle 1, A0 sends 1k USDC to A1, A1 deposits 1k USDC, get 1k sToken and make 1k sToken withdrawal request for circle 3.
3. At circle 1, A1 sends 1k sToken to A2, A2 make 1k sToken withdrawal request for circle 3.
4. At circle 1, repeat step 3 for A3 to A100. Now the attacker has 100k withdrawal permission on circle 3 with only 1k USDC locked.
5. At each subsequent circle, by repeat step 3 ~ 4, the attacker keeps 100k withdrawal permission while ````circle > 3```` with no USDC locked, that is he can freely withdraw up to 100k sToken at any  circle's open stage.
6. A0 send 1k USDC each to A1~A100 which doesn't hold any sToken.
7. Circle >= 3 and open stage begins, A1~A100 which doesn't hold any sToken yet deposit 1k USDC to the pool and get total about 99k sToken.
8. Circle >= 3 and open stage is gonna end or a default event is about to occur, withdraw 99k sToken risk freely and keep 1k sToken for step 3 ~ 4.

## Impact
Sellers can exploit it to take risk free premium from the pool.
