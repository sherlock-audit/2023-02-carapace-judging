# Missing check in _deposit function to verify if a user has sufficent funds to cover the deposit

## Summary
Missing check in `_deposit` function to verify if a user has sufficent funds to cover the deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ProtectionPool.sol`, there is no check in the `_deposit` function to verify if a user has sufficent funds to cover the deposit.

## Impact
1. Potential loss of gas fees, reputation risk - If a user does not have enough funds to cover the deposit, the contract will revert the transaction, which causes the user to lose the gas fees paid for the transaction. This causes frustration to the user which may in turn impact the reputation of the protocol. 

2. Potential inconsistencies in pool - In the case where a user makes a deposit without sufficient funds and the transaction is not reverted, it could lead to a situation where the pool shows more funds than it actually has. This will greatly impact the essence of the protocol.
