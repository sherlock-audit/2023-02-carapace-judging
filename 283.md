# DoS in `_calculateClaimableAmount()`

## Summary

The `lockedCapitals` array could grow unbounded and result in DoS when trying to Claim Unlocked Capital.


## Vulnerability Detail

When adding new item to `lockedCapitals` array, there is no limit on how many items can be created. 
```solidity
File: contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol
390:   function _moveFromActiveToLockedState(

401:     /// step 2: create and store an instance of locked capital for the lending pool
402:     poolState.lockedCapitals[_lendingPool].push(
403:       LockedCapital({
404:         snapshotId: _snapshotId,
405:         amount: _lockedCapital,
406:         locked: true
407:       })
408:     );
```

As a result, the `lockedCapitals` array could grow quite large, the transactionâ€™s gas cost could exceed the block gas limit and make it impossible to call this function `_calculateClaimableAmount()` at all. Since inside the for loop, there are storage load and function calls, the gas cost of these are relatively high.

```solidity
453:   function _calculateClaimableAmount(

476:     uint256 _length = lockedCapitals.length;
477:     for (uint256 _index = 0; _index < _length; ) {
478:       LockedCapital storage lockedCapital = lockedCapitals[_index];
```


## Impact

The pool could fail to call function `calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital()`. User fund could get locked and unable to claim.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a reasonable upper limit based on block gas limits. For large size `lockedCapitals` array, the handling of each `lockedCapital` struct can be break into separate parts with different function calls, and combine the results at last in another function.
