# c7e7eff - Incorrect amount of underlying might be locked when a lending pool transitions to Late state

## Summary
When a lendingpool is moved to locked state only the protections for which the loan NFTs are held in the same account as the protection was bought from will be acounted for when calculating the amount to be locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a lending pool transitions to the `Late` state and `lockCapital()` is called on the protection pool, the remaining principal for the buyer is calculated.
This is done by looping over all the protections for the lending pool and calling `calculateRemaininPrincipal()` on the `ReferenceLendingPools` contract. This then calls the `GoldfinchAdapter` where a check is performed whether the buyer is also the owner of the pool token NFT. 
The transition of a lending pool can happen at any time by the calling the `assesStates()` function on the DefaultStateManager contract. The Goldfinch pool token NFT can at that time be owned by another address for a number of reasons (cold storage , Defi, ...) and consequently the due protection amount will not be locked. Additionally although the `assessStates()` function is typically called daily by OZ defender, it can be called by anyone (including a seller) as there is no access control on the function. This means a seller can trigger this when they notice the NFTs are (temporarily) not held in the accounts of the buyers thereby reducing their obligation.

## Impact
Any number of protections might not be taken into account when calculating the due amount of underlying to lock. The sellers can reduce their cost and some buyers can completely lose their protection.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As the protection is valid it should not matter if the buyer is the owner at the time of calculating and locking the necessary amount. As such the check at the time of locking should be removed. The check can still be done when claiming the protection amount by the buyer.
