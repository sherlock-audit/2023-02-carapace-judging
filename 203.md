# Buyers could front run `assessState` to always get benefitted when loan defaults.

## Summary
When verifying pools the contract uses an outdated variable to check the pool status instead of calling to get a live value. 
Front runners could watch mempool and `buyProtection()` right before a lendingPool status is updated to `Defaulted` and get paid.

## Vulnerability Detail

ProtectionPool references "outdated" DefaultManager to check lending pools status even though it could check update status in ReferenceLendingPool.


`buyProtection` -> `verifyAndCreateProtection` -> `_verifyLendingPoolIsActive` uses outdated pool status. 
If attacker is watching mempool it could buy protection for soon-to-be-defaulted lending pool right before `assessStates()` updates the pool status. He would then be entitled for payment from the seller.

## Impact
Attacker would be entitled for immediate payment from seller.

## Recommendation
Reference up-to-date state through `ReferenceLendingPools.sol` instead of stale state in `DefaultStateManager.sol`.
