# No hard limit on protection buyers can block calls to `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections`

## Summary
If the number of active protecions on a lending pools gets high enough, this can lead to calls to `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` reverting as the max gas per block is reached.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no hard limit on the number of protection buyers. While the leverage ratio stays within bounds defined by `leverageRatioFloor` and `leverageRatioCeiling`, new calls to `buyProtection` are allowed, increasing `protectionInfos` indefinitely.

Based on simulations, calling `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` for a single lending pool has base gas cost of aprox. 120k gas and each new active protection incurs an aditional 5.6k gas. Therefore if a single lending pool gets to +5000 active protections, `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` gas costs would get dangerously close to the 30kk hard limit on EVM maximum gas per block.

## Impact
If active protection instances get high enough, calling `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` may become impossible. This state is irreversible as there is no other way remove active protection besides `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` itself. As a consequence the functionality of the protection pool would get affected, blocking premium collection and freezing all protections in the lending pool.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Consider setting hard limit on number of active protection on a per-lending pool basis.
