# Gas Limit Denial of Service via unbounded operations on active protections enumerable set

## Summary

`ProtectionPool` is vulnerable to denial of service due to [unbounded operations](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/denial-of-service/#gas-limit-dos-on-a-contract-via-unbounded-operations) on the enumerable set of active protections.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each block has an upper bound on the amount of gas that can be spent, and thus the amount computation that can be done. This is the Block Gas Limit. If the gas spent exceeds this limit, the transaction will fail. This leads to a Gas Limit DoS on a Contract via Unbounded Operations.

`ProtectionPool.lockCapital` and `ProtectionPool.accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` loop through the whole enumerable set of active protections. If this list becomes too big, these calls might never be included in a block, which might lead to a denial of service.

## Impact

Denial of service of the protocol (accruing premium and locking capital) if the set of active protections grows too much.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Plan for a full enumeration to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. Keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point.
