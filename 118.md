# Growing of totalSupply after successive lock/unlockCapital can freeze protection pools by uint overflow

## Summary
In a protection pool, after enough cycles of locking capital/depositing, totalSupply can grow to overflow uint256. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `convertToSToken`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L589-L606

`_getExchangeRate()` can become arbitrarily small after a funds locking, since locked funds are substracted from `totalSTokenUnderlying`;
This means that new depositors can get a lot more shares than depositors from before funds locking. 
This behavior is correct, because otherwise previous depositors would have an oversized share of the new capital. However this has the negative effect of growing `totalSupply` exponentially, eventually reaching `type(uint).max` and overflowing (reverting every new deposit).

## Impact
Protocol can come to a halt if totalSupply reaches `type(uint).max`.

## Recommendation
Design the token in a way that it can be rebased regularly.
