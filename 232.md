# Payable functions

## Summary

Contracts contain `payable` functions with no way to retrieve the native token.

## Vulnerability Detail

To save on gas, many protocol functions have applied a `payable` modifier, for example:
```solidity
  function addReferenceLendingPool(
    address _lendingPoolAddress,
    LendingProtocol _lendingPoolProtocol,
    uint256 _protectionPurchaseLimitInDays
  ) external payable onlyOwner {
    _addReferenceLendingPool(
      _lendingPoolAddress,
      _lendingPoolProtocol,
      _protectionPurchaseLimitInDays
    );
  }
```
As mentioned, "Function is marked payable as gas optimization". This means these functions can have a value attached to them even though the protocol does not have any intention to use it.

## Impact

If the native token (ETH) accidentally reaches the contract, there is no way to send it back unless the contract is upgraded.

and many more similar functions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider if this optimization is really worth it, and you might consider adding ETH and maybe other token rescue functions.
