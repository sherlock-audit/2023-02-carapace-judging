# Anyone can buy a protection in any lending pool, so long as the protection is size 0. Thus, anyone can shut down all premium accrual for a pool

## Summary

Anyone can buy a protection for 0 capital in any lending pool. This is not significant on its own, but it enables anyone to carry out a protection-dusting attack that causes a fatal OUT OF GAS error blocking all logic for late payments and premium accrual ( see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace-jkoppel/issues/2 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace-jkoppel/issues/4).

## Vulnerability Detail

When buying protection, the only check on the identity of the buyer is this one, in ReferenceLendingPools.canBuyProtection

```solidity
    /// Verify that protection amount is less than or equal to the remaining principal
    /// that buyer has lent to the underlying lending pool
    return
      _purchaseParams.protectionAmount <=
      calculateRemainingPrincipal(
        _purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress,
        _buyer,
        _purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
      );
  }
```

The Goldfinch implementation of calculateRemainingPrincipal returns 0 when _buyer is not a lender, and never reverts

```solidity
 function calculateRemainingPrincipal(
    address _lendingPoolAddress,
    address _lender,
    uint256 _nftLpTokenId
  ) public view override returns (uint256 _principalRemaining) {
    IPoolTokens _poolTokens = _getPoolTokens();

    /// If lender owns the NFT, then calculate the remaining principal
    /// otherwise, the remaining principal is zero
    if (_poolTokens.ownerOf(_nftLpTokenId) == _lender) {
          ....
    }
  }
```

Note that _principalRemaining gets initialized to 0 on declaration and is never updated. By standard Solidity semantics, this function hence returns 0 for non-lenders.

There are checks for the maximum protection that can be bought, but no other checks for the minimum protection that can be bought.

Therefore, anyone can buy a protection, causing loops over protectionInfos and activeProtectionIndices to OUT OF GAS.

This broadens the audience who can carry out the attack  in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace-jkoppel/issues/2 to literally anyone.

## Impact

Anyone can shut down late-payment logic and interest accrual for any protection pool
