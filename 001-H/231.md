# # [M-01] Loop through protections is subject to DDOS attack

## Summary

`protectionInfos` length is under control of protection buyers. There are operations such as `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` which loops through the array. It can be subject to DDOS attack.


## Vulnerability Details

When `ProtectionPool.accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` is called, it loops through the `protectionInfos` array. However the `protectionInfos` length is under control of protection buyers. They could spam by buying a very large number of protections. The `protectionInfos` length will be very large and can lead to fail transaction due to out of gas or over block gas limit. 

The POC below demonstrate a buyer buy 3 protections, each has protection amount equals 1 USDC. He can spam much more.

POC:

        it("Buy multiple protections successfully", async () => {
          const _initialBuyerAccountId: BigNumber = BigNumber.from(1);
          const _initialPremiumAmountOfAccount: BigNumber = BigNumber.from(0);
          const _premiumTotalOfLendingPoolIdBefore: BigNumber = (
            await protectionPool.getLendingPoolDetail(_lendingPool2)
          )[0];
          const _premiumTotalBefore: BigNumber = (
            await protectionPool.getPoolDetails()
          )[2];
          const _expectedPremiumAmount = parseUSDC("2186.178950");

          const _protectionAmount = parseUSDC("1"); // 100,000 USDC
          _purchaseParams = {
            lendingPoolAddress: _lendingPool2,
            nftLpTokenId: 590,
            protectionAmount: _protectionAmount,
            protectionDurationInSeconds: getDaysInSeconds(40)
          };

        await protectionPool
          .connect(_protectionBuyer1)
          .buyProtection(_purchaseParams, parseUSDC("10000"));

        await protectionPool
          .connect(_protectionBuyer1)
          .buyProtection(_purchaseParams, parseUSDC("10000"));

        await protectionPool
          .connect(_protectionBuyer1)
          .buyProtection(_purchaseParams, parseUSDC("10000"));

          expect(
            (
              await protectionPool.getActiveProtections(
                PROTECTION_BUYER1_ADDRESS
              )
            ).length
          ).to.eq(3);
        });

## Impact

The `ProtectionPool.accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` is called daily to accrue premium and change the protection to expire. If it cannot be called because of DDOS attack, the protocol will not work properly:
- Premium is not accrued for protection sellers. It leads to lose funds to seller (the premium amount).
- Protections will not be marked expired and always in `activeProtectionIndexes`. If the capital are locked, it will count all the expired protection and overlocked the capital. It leads to lose funds to seller.

The protocol can be halted.

## Recommendation

Possible solutions:
- The protection purchase could have minimum amount, so the attack will be more costly to perform.
