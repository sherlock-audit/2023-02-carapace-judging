# DoS when accruing Premium


## Summary

The `activeProtectionIndexes` array could grow unbounded and result in DoS when accruing Premium.


## Vulnerability Detail

When crate protection, there is no limit on how many protections can be created. 
```solidity
File: contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol
795:   function _verifyAndCreateProtection() {

887:     lendingPoolDetail.activeProtectionIndexes.add(_protectionIndex);
888:     protectionBuyerAccounts[msg.sender].activeProtectionIndexes.add(
889:       _protectionIndex
890:     );
```

As a result, the `activeProtectionIndexes` array could grow quite large, the transactionâ€™s gas cost could exceed the block gas limit and make it impossible to call this function `lockCapital()` at all. Since inside the for loop, there are storage load and function calls, the gas cost of these are relatively high.

```solidity
963:   function _accruePremiumAndExpireProtections(

980:     uint256 _length = _protectionIndexes.length;
981:     for (uint256 j; j < _length; ) {
982:       uint256 _protectionIndex = _protectionIndexes[j];
983:       ProtectionInfo storage protectionInfo = protectionInfos[_protectionIndex];
```


## Impact

The pool could fail to accrue Premium. The contract could not deliver expected functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a reasonable upper limit based on block gas limits. For large size `activeProtectionIndexes` array, the handling of accruing Premium can be break into separate parts with different function calls, and combine the results at last in another function.
