# Possible DOS in `getAllProtections()` and `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` functions because of unbounded gas consumption

## Summary
In the ProtectionPool.sol contract `getAllProtections()` and `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` functions are declared . `getAllProtections()` returns the Protections array and `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` iterates through a number of lendingPoolIndexs. We can only get this list of Protections from the `getAllProtections()` view function. for loops inside `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` will run for each lendingPoolIndex.  Every time this calculation is gas-consuming.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The `getAllProtections()`  function fetched all elements of the list from storage, which is really gas-consuming and even can break the block gas limit in case the list is too large. Even though users donâ€™t need to pay gas for the view function, this function is still failed if its gas cost larger than the block gas limit. most likely `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` will always fail because its first for loop iterates through lendingPoolIndex and inside this for loop there is another for loop which will be iterateing through protections of that lendingPool.  which is more gas consuming

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function `getAllProtections()` should return an array in range or should iterate in range
The function `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()` should not dp this amount of iterate in same function
