# DoS in `lockCapital()`

## Summary

The `activeProtectionIndexes` array could grow unbounded and result in DoS when calling `lockCapital()`.


## Vulnerability Detail

When crate protection, there is no limit on how many protections can be created. 
```solidity
File: contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol
795:   function _verifyAndCreateProtection() {

887:     lendingPoolDetail.activeProtectionIndexes.add(_protectionIndex);
888:     protectionBuyerAccounts[msg.sender].activeProtectionIndexes.add(
889:       _protectionIndex
890:     );
```

As a result, the `activeProtectionIndexes` array could grow quite large, the transactionâ€™s gas cost could exceed the block gas limit and make it impossible to call this function `lockCapital()` at all. Since inside the for loop, there are storage load and function calls, the gas cost of these are relatively high.

```solidity
357:   function lockCapital(address _lendingPoolAddress)

382:     uint256 _length = activeProtectionIndexes.length();
383:     for (uint256 i; i < _length; ) {

385:       uint256 _protectionIndex = activeProtectionIndexes.at(i);
386:       ProtectionInfo storage protectionInfo = protectionInfos[_protectionIndex];
```


## Impact

The pool could fail to lock capital in case of default. Buyers of protection will lose fund. The contract could not deliver expected functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a reasonable upper limit based on block gas limits. For large size `activeProtectionIndexes` array, the handling of locked amounts can be break into separate parts with different function calls, and combine the results at last in another function.
