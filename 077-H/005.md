# Run withdraw() after accruePremiumAndExpireProtections() can redeem more more underlying tokens

## Summary
After function ```accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()``` has been called, the value of variable ```totalSTokenUnderlying```  can be increased. This ```totalSTokenUnderlying``` is an important factor in the calculation of the exchange rate, resulting in an increase in the exchange rate, as the user redeems more underlying tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _sTokenWithdrawalAmount, address _receiver)
    external
    override
    whenPoolIsOpen
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
  {
    /// Step 1: Retrieve withdrawal details for current pool cycle index
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );
    WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
      _currentCycleIndex
    ];

    /// Step 2: Verify withdrawal request exists in this withdrawal cycle for the user
    uint256 _sTokenRequested = withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender];
    if (_sTokenRequested == 0) {
      revert NoWithdrawalRequested(msg.sender, _currentCycleIndex);
    }

    /// Step 3: Verify that withdrawal amount is not more than the requested amount.
    if (_sTokenWithdrawalAmount > _sTokenRequested) {
      revert WithdrawalHigherThanRequested(msg.sender, _sTokenRequested);
    }

    /// Step 4: calculate underlying amount to transfer based on sToken withdrawal amount
    uint256 _underlyingAmountToTransfer = convertToUnderlying(
      _sTokenWithdrawalAmount
    );

    /// Step 5: burn sTokens shares.
    /// This step must be done after calculating underlying amount to be transferred
    _burn(msg.sender, _sTokenWithdrawalAmount);

    /// Step 6: Update total sToken underlying amount
    totalSTokenUnderlying -= _underlyingAmountToTransfer;

    /// Step 7: update seller's withdrawal amount and total requested withdrawal amount
    withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender] -= _sTokenWithdrawalAmount;
    withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested -= _sTokenWithdrawalAmount;

    /// Step 8: transfer underlying token to receiver
    poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransfer(
      _receiver,
      _underlyingAmountToTransfer
    );

    emit WithdrawalMade(msg.sender, _sTokenWithdrawalAmount, _receiver);
  }
```
When user withdraws funds from the protocol,the protocol will convert the specified amount of sToken share to the amount of underlying token based on exchange rate.
```solidity
function convertToUnderlying(uint256 _sTokenShares)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    return
      ProtectionPoolHelper.scale18DecimalsAmtToUnderlyingDecimals(
        ((_sTokenShares * _getExchangeRate()) / Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS), /// underlying amount in 18 decimals
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );
  }
 function _getExchangeRate() internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _totalScaledCapital = ProtectionPoolHelper
      .scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
        totalSTokenUnderlying,
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );
    uint256 _totalSTokenSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 _exchangeRate = (_totalScaledCapital *
      Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _totalSTokenSupply;

}
```
As the code above ,underlying amount to transfer is calculated according to the formula  ```_sTokenShares * _getExchangeRate()```. The higher exchange rate, the more underlying tokens user gets. And the exchange rate is calculated according to the formula     uint256 _exchangeRate = (_totalScaledCapital * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _totalSTokenSupply; The total supply only increases when mint.
The function ```accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()``` is used to accrue premium  and protection removed for all lending pools. And it is can be called by anyone at anytime. When update storage vars , if ```_totalPremiumAccrued > 0```, the protocol will add the total sToken underlying amount by the ```_totalPremiumAccrued```. The amount of totalSTokenUnderlying will increase ,then the exchange rate will become higner.
So run withdraw() after accruePremiumAndExpireProtections() can redeem more more underlying tokens in this scenario.

1.Assume Alice want to withdraw some underlying tokens in the open duration.
2. She invoke function ```accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```  or  monitors the transactions in the mempool, once she finds out about the above transactions, she run the ```withdraw()``` after the functaill call ```accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()```.
3. Alice withdraws more underlying tokens.

## Impact
User withdraws more underlying tokens resulting in a loss of asset to the protocol.
