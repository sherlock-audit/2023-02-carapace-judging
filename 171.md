# `ProtectionPool.deposit` has no slippage control

## Summary

The function `ProtectionPool.deposit` has no slippage control. Because of that, protection sellers are not able to make the transaction revert when the `sToken` shares they got were not what they expected. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `ProtectionPool.deposit` has no slippage control, which means that protection sellers may be frontrun and receive fewer shares than expected. This can occur, for example, if premium accrues before a [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1035-L1036) and `totalSTokenUnderlying` is [increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L346).

A similar issue of EIP-4626 vaults is [described here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/address-eip-4626-inflation-attacks-with-virtual-shares-and-assets/12677), where a victim can be frontrun and impacted due to the absence of slippage protection in the deposit function.

## Impact

Protection sellers can receive fewer shares than expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `minSTokenShares` or analogous parameter (representing the expected sToken shares minted) to the `deposit` function so that protection sellers can control the slippage on their deposits
