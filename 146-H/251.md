# `GoldfinchAdapter` fails to detect late payments at or after pool's term has ended

## Summary
`GoldfinchAdapter` can incorrectly identify the state of a pool: a late pool can be detected as an expired one. A Goldfinch pool can be late at or after its term has ended, but it'll be identified as expired by the adapter. Since expired pools are not eligible for protection payouts, buyers of protections for such pools may not receive payments due to the failed pool state detection.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol [identifies multiple states](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ReferenceLendingPools.sol#L331-L346) in which Goldfinch lending pools can be. Among them are "late" and "expired" states. A late pool is a pool that [has a late payment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/adapters/GoldfinchAdapter.sol#L289); an expired pool is a pool which [term has ended](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/adapters/GoldfinchAdapter.sol#L75) or which was [fully repaid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/adapters/GoldfinchAdapter.sol#L76). The definition of expired pools, however, misses one important detail: a pool with ended term can have a late payment. So, an expired pool can also be a late pool.

The `termEndTime` variable of a Goldfinch pool is set when the [first drawdown is made](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/CreditLine.sol#L104-L106)â€“it's set based on `termInDays`, which is the length of the term of the credit line. In `CreditLine`, `termEndTime` is only used to [disallow drawdowns after the terms has ended](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/CreditLine.sol#L94). However, repayments are not limited by the term end timestamp: the [pay](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/TranchedPool.sol#L324-L329) function and the [assess](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/CreditLine.sol#L186-L205) function (which handles payments) doesn't check if payment is done after `termEndTime`. Moreover, next due date [can be set to `termEndTime`](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/CreditLine.sol#L223), meaning that an on schedule payment can be made at `termEndTime`.

When creating protections the duration of a protection must pass only these two checks:
1. it [must be greater than the minimal one](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L455);
1. and it [must not end after next cycle's end timestamp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L467).

Thus, the end of a protection may be at the `termEndTime` value of a Goldfinch or after it. In case it's at `termEndTime` or after it, the pool will be identified as expired, while it may still be late on a payment. The protection that ends at or after `termEndTime` will not be paid, erroneously, while still covering the moment when a payment was late in the pool.
## Impact
Protections that cover pools with late payments may not be compensated due to the pools being identified as expired, not as late. The buyers of such protections lose funds because they pay premium and don't receive a coverage while being eligible for it.
## Code Snippet
1. One of the definitions of an expired pool, as defined in the Goldfinch adapter, is when its term has ended:
[GoldfinchAdapter.sol#L75](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/adapters/GoldfinchAdapter.sol#L75)
1. However, pool's term end timestamp only controls when drawdowns can be made:
[CreditLine.sol#L94](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/CreditLine.sol#L94)
1. Late payments can still be repaid after `termEndTime`:
[TranchedPool.sol#L324-L329](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/TranchedPool.sol#L324-L329)

## Recommendation
In [ReferenceLendingPools._getLendingPoolStatus](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ReferenceLendingPools.sol#L318) consider calling `_adapter.isLendingPoolExpired` after the late state checks. [CreditLine._isLate](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/aa0b9fa2b0e0e94b172ef1bcfd1ee4f95da2bdf5/packages/protocol/contracts/protocol/core/CreditLine.sol#L241) doesn't check `termEndTime` and detects late payments even if a pool is past its term end.
