# non claimed `unlockedFunds` are stuck in `ProtectionPool`

## Summary
If a pool goes back and forth between Late and Active and a protection seller fails to claim their unlocked funds they are lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a pool becomes late on payment the funds protecting that pool are locked. If the borrower then pays their payment the pool will eventually go back to active making the locked funds available for sellers to claim.

`DefaultStateManager.sol` keeps track of in which snapshot the funds were locked. It also tracks which snapshots the seller has claimed to make sure the seller cannot claim previously claimed funds.

However, the unlocked capital is overwritten so that only the latest "unlock" is claimable:

```solidity
File: DefaultStateManager.sol

500:        /// The claimable amount for the given seller is proportional to the seller's share of the total supply at the snapshot
501:        /// claimable amount = (seller's snapshot balance / total supply at snapshot) * locked capital amount
502:        _claimableUnlockedCapital =
503:          (_poolSToken.balanceOfAt(_seller, _snapshotId) *
504:            lockedCapital.amount) /
505:          _poolSToken.totalSupplyAt(_snapshotId);
```

If a lender fails to collect their payment and a new "unlock" happens the previously unlocked funds will be stuck in the `ProtectionPool` contract.

## Impact
A protection seller can lose their funds if they don't claim them in time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since `_calculateClaimableAmount` already does a check that you are not claiming for an old snapshot you can simply add the unclaimed funds:
