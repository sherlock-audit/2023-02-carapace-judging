# Admin cannot `pause` or `remove` the ReferenceLendingPools and the LendingProtocolAdapter that is hacked or the underlying DeFi protocol used as a LendingProtocolAdapter is paused

## Summary
The **ContractFactory** create two Pools and one Adapter like this:
- ProtectionPool
- ReferenceLendingPools 
- LendingProtocolAdapter (i.e. GoldfinchAdapter)

However, besides the ProtectionPool, there is no `pause` or `removal` function within the ReferenceLendingPools and the LendingProtocolAdapter. 

This lead to a bad situation that even if some ReferenceLendingPools or/and some LendingProtocolAdapter would be hacked or some underlying DeFi protocol (i.e. Goldfinch) used as an LendingProtocolAdapter would be hacked or paused, there is no way for admin to `pause` (`remove`) these ReferenceLendingPools or/and LendingProtocolAdapter.


## Vulnerability Detail
The **ContractFactory** create two Pools and one Adapter like this:
- ProtectionPool
- ReferenceLendingPools
- LendingProtocolAdapter (GoldfinchAdapter)

  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/ContractFactory.sol#L177
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/ContractFactory.sol#L213


Within the ProtectionPool,
`pause()` / `unpause()` are defined as the admin functions like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L447-L459
```solidity
  /** admin functions */

  /// @notice allows the owner to pause the contract
  /// @dev This function is marked as payable for gas optimization.
  function pause() external payable onlyOwner {
    _pause();
  }

  /// @notice allows the owner to unpause the contract
  /// @dev This function is marked as payable for gas optimization.
  function unpause() external payable onlyOwner {
    _unpause();
  }
```
Then, each function within the ProtectionPool can be controlled by the `whenNotPaused()` modifier like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L165
```solidity
  function buyProtection(
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount
  ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant { //// @audit - the whenNotPaused() modifier is used here
    ...
``` 

However, besides the ProtectionPool, there is no `pause` or `removal` function within the ReferenceLendingPools and the LendingProtocolAdapter. 

This means that an admin can pause in only ProtectionPool level. On the other hand, the admin cannot pause in the ReferenceLendingPools level and the LendingProtocolAdapter level for the moment.

This lead to a bad situation that even if some ReferenceLendingPools or/and some LendingProtocolAdapter would be hacked or some underlying DeFi protocol (i.e. Goldfinch) used as an LendingProtocolAdapter would be hacked or paused, there is no way for admin to `pause` (`remove`) these ReferenceLendingPools or/and LendingProtocolAdapter.

## Impact
even if some ReferenceLendingPools or/and some LendingProtocolAdapter would be hacked or some underlying DeFi protocol (i.e. Goldfinch) used as an LendingProtocolAdapter would be hacked or paused, there is no way for admin to `pause` (`remove`) these ReferenceLendingPools or/and LendingProtocolAdapter.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding function and modifiers like below to both the **ReferenceLendingPools** and the **LendingProtocolAdapter** so that an **admin** can `pause` or `remove` the ReferenceLendingPools or/and the LendingProtocolAdapter that was hacked or the underlying DeFi protocol (i.e. Goldfinch) used as an LendingProtocolAdapter would be hacked or paused,:
- the `pause()` / `unpause()` function or the `remove()` function
- In case of adding the the `pause()` / `unpause()` function, the `whenNotPaused()` modifier should be added to each functions within the the ReferenceLendingPools and the LendingProtocolAdapter
