# If unlocked capital in pool falls below minRequiredCapital, then protection can be bought for minimum premium

## Summary

If the unlocked capital in a pool falls below the minRequiredCapital, then protection can be bought for minimum premium

## Vulnerability Detail

In PremiumCalculator.calculatePremium, we see that if the risk factor "cannot  be calculated," it uses the minimum premium.

```solidity
    if (
      RiskFactorCalculator.canCalculateRiskFactor(
        _totalCapital,
        _leverageRatio,
        _poolParameters.leverageRatioFloor,
        _poolParameters.leverageRatioCeiling,
        _poolParameters.minRequiredCapital
      )
    ) {
      ...
    } else {
      /// This means that the risk factor cannot be calculated because of either
      /// min capital not met or leverage ratio out of range.
      /// Hence, the premium is the minimum premium
      _isMinPremium = true;
    }
```

In RiskFactor.canCalculateRiskFactor, we see there are three conditions when this is so:

```solidity
  function canCalculateRiskFactor(
    uint256 _totalCapital,
    uint256 _leverageRatio,
    uint256 _leverageRatioFloor,
    uint256 _leverageRatioCeiling,
    uint256 _minRequiredCapital
  ) external pure returns (bool _canCalculate) {
    if (
      _totalCapital < _minRequiredCapital ||
      _leverageRatio < _leverageRatioFloor ||
      _leverageRatio > _leverageRatioCeiling
    ) {
      _canCalculate = false;
    } else {
      _canCalculate = true;
    }
  }
}
```

If the leverage ratio is above the ceiling, then protection should be very cheap, and it is correct to use the minimum premium. If the leverage ratio is above the floor, then protection cannot be purchased.

However, we see that the minimum premium is also used if _totalCapital is below _minRequiredCapital. In this case, protection should be very expensive, but it will instead be very cheap.

Total capital can fall this low in a couple ways. One way is if most sellers withdraw their funds and most protection positions expire. Then the pool can have a very small amount of capital while still having a leverage ratio within the window.  Another is if most of the capital is locked. In that case, the protection likely cannot be bought because the leverage ratio is likely to be too low. However, when capital is locked, the corresponding protection should not count against the leverage ratio, as that can prevent buyers from buying protection even when the pool is very well capitalized ( see https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace-jkoppel/issues/11 ). If that issue is fixed, then this issue can appear when capital is locked.

## Impact

Buyers can get very cheap protection at a time when it should be expensive.

Prohibit protection purchases when capital falls below the minimum required capital
