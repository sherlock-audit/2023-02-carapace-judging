# Pools can be insolvent

## Summary
Pools can be insolvent
## Vulnerability Detail
`ProtectionPool` contract implements `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` in order to accrue the premium from all existing protections and update the total premium accrued. As per the [NATSPEC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IProtectionPool.sol#L291-L299)
>This function accrues premium from the last accrual timestamp to the latest payment timestamp of the underlying lending pool.
This function  also marks protections expired when protection duration has expired.

The flow of the function is as follows;

1. When `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` called daily via a cron job, it validates the parameter pool length and iterates all lending pools of the protection pool to check if there is new payment after last premium accrual.

2. And it continues to iterate all active protections for the lending pool and accrue premium and expire protections if there is new payment via internally calling `_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections`
[Permalink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L317-L328)
3. `_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` function accrue premium for all active protections and mark expired protections for the specified lending pool. Accordingly first it gets all active protection indexes for the lending pool and iterates through all active protection indexes for the lending pool to return `_accruedPremiumInUnderlying` and `_expired` status. 
To return these two values, it calls `ProtectionPoolHelper.verifyAndAccruePremium`

4. `verifyAndAccruePremium` of `ProtectionPoolHelper` contract accrues premium for given loan protection from last premium accrual to the latest payment timestamp. So with the given parameters it calculates the expiration timestamp and the expiry status of the protection by the code below;
```solidity
    /// Calculate the protection expiration timestamp and
    /// Check if the protection is expired or not.
    uint256 _expirationTimestamp = protectionInfo.startTimestamp +
      protectionInfo.purchaseParams.protectionDurationInSeconds;
    _protectionExpired = block.timestamp > _expirationTimestamp;
```

But there is a wrong usage of operator here. While `_expirationTimestamp` stands for the time stamp in which the protection is expired, the code checks whether the `block.timestamp` is greater than the `_expirationTimestamp`. However, if the `block.timestamp` reaches `_expirationTimestamp`, it means that the protection is expired.
Correct usage should be `_protectionExpired = block.timestamp >= _expirationTimestamp;` in order to mark the protection as expired.

The effects come after this point. Since the function doesn't mark the expired protection as expired, on [line #259](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L259), it calculates the `_secondsUntilLatestPayment` in order to re-calculate the accrued premium amount by calling `AccruedPremiumCalculator.calculateAccruedPremium`.

And `calculateAccruedPremium` calculates the accrued premium from start to end second, scaled to 18 decimals. However,since the expired protection is not accounted as expired, the same calculation could already be made by the previous cron job for the same pool and the same protection.
Thus, the result of this duplicate calculation reflects in the `_accruedPremiumInUnderlying` which means that the total `_accruedPremiumInUnderlying` value is inflated by the wrong calculated amount and actually it's a lower value. 

This breaks the accounting of the pool and it might end up with insolvent pools.


## Impact
Insolvent lending pools

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    /// Calculate the protection expiration timestamp and
    /// Check if the protection is expired or not.
    uint256 _expirationTimestamp = protectionInfo.startTimestamp +
      protectionInfo.purchaseParams.protectionDurationInSeconds;
    _protectionExpired = block.timestamp > _expirationTimestamp;
```

## Recommendation
Correct usage should be `_protectionExpired = block.timestamp >= _expirationTimestamp;`
