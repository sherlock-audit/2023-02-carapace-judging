# # [H-03] Protection buyer could front-run the DefaultStateManager to buy protection for the late payment lending pool

## Summary

Protection buyer could front-run the DefaultStateManager to buy protection for the late payment lending pool because of the delay in state update in DefaultStateManager contract.

## Vulnerability Details

When a buyer purchase a protection, the protection pool contract checks to see if the lendind pool state is active

However instead of checking the lending pool state directly, the protection pool calls `defaultStateManager.getLendingPoolStatus`. In case there is a small delay in updating the lending pool state in defaultStateManager (very likely since the defaultStateManager updates states daily by calling `defaultStateManager.assessStates`), a buyer could front-run the defaultStateManager and renew protection to 100% of the protection to minimize his imminent loss if the lending pool is in late state within `lendingPoolInfo.protectionPurchaseLimitTimestamp` (usually set to 90 days). 

## Impact

Protection buyer is able to purchase protection when the lending pool is in late status. It ensures the loss for protection sellers and Carapace protocol since they have to provide sufficient capital for payouts.

## Tool used

Manual

## Recommendation

When a buyer purchase a protection, call `defaultStateManager.assessStateBatch` and update state for all the lending pools in the protection pool before allowing purchase.
Avoid getting the lending pool states from defaultStateManager state variable since it may be out of date.
