# Protection buys may be unable to be renewed due to ````pause```` operation of ````ProtectionPool```` contract

## Summary
The ````ProtectionPool```` contract can be paused by owner. If the paused time starts before or in the duration of renew grace periods of some protection buys and stops after the end of their grace periods, then the affected protection buys would not be able to be renewed.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown on L179 of ````renewProtection()````, there is a ````whenNotPaused ```` modifier to make ````renewProtection()```` can only be called while the contract is not paused.
```solidity
File: contracts\core\pool\ProtectionPool.sol
176:   function renewProtection(
177:     ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
178:     uint256 _maxPremiumAmount
179:   ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
...
195:   }

```
And there is also a grace period which allows renews to be executed only during the time range.
```solidity
File: contracts\libraries\ProtectionPoolHelper.sol
360:   function verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection(
...
365:   ) external view {
...
382:     /// This means a buyer has expired protection for the same lending position
383:     if (
...
388:     ) {
389:       /// If we are NOT within grace period after the protection is expired, then revert
390:       if (
391:         block.timestamp >
392:         (expiredProtectionInfo.startTimestamp +
393:           expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.protectionDurationInSeconds +
394:           _renewalGracePeriodInSeconds)
395:       ) {
396:         revert IProtectionPool.CanNotRenewProtectionAfterGracePeriod();
397:       }
398:     }
399:   }
```

So it's clear that if a pause operation occupies the time that should be spent on the renew operation, it may cause the renew operation to fail and cannot be recovered.

## Impact
The affected protection buys would not be able to be renewed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Record the paused time ranges, if renew period of a protection buy is occupied by pause operation, then the renew period should be extended accordingly.
