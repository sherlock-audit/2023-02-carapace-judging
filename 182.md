# Protection amount can be increased when renewing which opens possible manipulation vectors

## Summary
Protection amount can be increased when renewing which opens several manipulation vectors

## Vulnerability Detail
When renewing protection, nothing prevents the buyer to increase protection amount all the way up to the loan value. Buyer can purchase protection for a very low amount paying minimal premium and later increase it during renewal period if it benefits them.

In fact, due to the rounding in PremiumCalculator, the buyer will not pay any premium for dust protection amounts:

Possible exploits by the buyer:
- Can effectively bypass the requirement to buy protection in the first 90 days. Buyer can purchase minimal protection and pay little or no premium and then renew with a meaningful amount at some point in the future.
- Can effectively bypass minimal protection duration of 90 days. Again, purchasing minimal protection for the first 90 days, then renewing with the proper amount. Minimal renewal duration is 1 day which is significantly shorter.
- Can get to renewal period paying little or no premium with the intention to front-run defaults while on grace period (submitted as a separate issue)

## Impact
Submitting as Medium as it helps exploit grace period issue as well as leads to a number of lower severity issues.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Might consider not allowing to increase protection amount. However, if this functionality is desired (in case the underlying loan increases in value), work can be done to mitigate related issues. For example, increasing minimal renewal duration, and reducing grace period.
