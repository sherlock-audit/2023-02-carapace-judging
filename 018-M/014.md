# New cycle is not started correctly

## Summary
It seems new cycle is not instantly started post open cycle duration has elapsed. The cycle state is first placed in Locked state instead of starting a new cycle. This has adverse impact on other contracts like User unable to create protection even with correct params

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User buys protection which internally calls `_verifyProtectionDuration` function to check User passed duration accuracy

```solidity
function _verifyProtectionDuration(
    IProtectionPoolCycleManager poolCycleManager,
    address _poolAddress,
    uint256 _protectionStartTimestamp,
    uint256 _protectionDurationInSeconds,
    uint256 _minProtectionDurationInSeconds
  ) internal {
...
poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState(_poolAddress);
    uint256 _nextCycleEndTimestamp = poolCycleManager.getNextCycleEndTimestamp(
      _poolAddress
    );

    if (_protectionExpirationTimestamp > _nextCycleEndTimestamp) {
      revert IProtectionPool.ProtectionDurationTooLong(
        _protectionDurationInSeconds
      );
    }
...
}
```

2. This calls `calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` to determine the current pool cycle state

```solidity
function calculateAndSetPoolCycleState(address _protectionPoolAddress)
    external
    override
    returns (ProtectionPoolCycleState _newState)
  {
...
if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Open) {
      /// If current time is past the initial open duration, then move to LOCKED state.
      if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.openCycleDuration
      ) {
        poolCycle.currentCycleState = _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState
          .Locked;
      }
    }
    /// If cycle is locked, then check if it's time to start a new cycle.
    else if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Locked) {
      /// If current time is past the total cycle duration, then start a new cycle.
      if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.cycleDuration
      ) {
        /// move current cycle to a new cycle
        _startNewCycle(
          _protectionPoolAddress,
          poolCycle,
          poolCycle.currentCycleIndex + 1
        );
        _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState.Open;
      }
    }
...
}
```

3. Lets say pool state was open and `poolCycle.params.openCycleDuration` has already elapsed. This will change pool state to `Locked`

```solidity
if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.openCycleDuration
      ) {
        poolCycle.currentCycleState = _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState
          .Locked;
```

4. Since next `if` condition is part of `else` condition so it does not execute and function complete with `Locked` state. 

```solidity
else if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Locked) {
```

5. Since new pool cycle is not started so `getNextCycleEndTimestamp` gives outdated timestamp of this Locked pool cycle state and hence below condition fails

```solidity
if (_protectionExpirationTimestamp > _nextCycleEndTimestamp) {
      revert IProtectionPool.ProtectionDurationTooLong(
        _protectionDurationInSeconds
      );
    }
```

## Impact
User will not be able to create protection even with all correct params

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `else` keyword and always start a new cycle on Locked state

```diff
- else if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Locked) {
+ if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Locked) {
```
