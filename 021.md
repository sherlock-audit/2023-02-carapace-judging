# Lack of check of emergency shutdown of Goldfinch's lending pools in Carapace protocol

## Summary
Lack of check of emergency shutdown of Goldfinch's lending pools in Carapace protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
When getting a lending pool status, Carapace doesn't check if the pool is  shutdown due to emergency in Goldfinch.

`ReferenceLendingPools._getLendingPoolStatus` is an internal function called when adding a lending pool or assessing its state.
The function check the status by calling multiple functions of **GoldfinchAdapter** to return one of the following statuses:
1. LendingPoolStatus.**Expired**
2. LendingPoolStatus.**LateWithinGracePeriod**
3. LendingPoolStatus.**Late**

if all above statuses are invalid then it returns LendingPoolStatus.**Active**.
```sh
    if (_adapter.isLendingPoolExpired(_lendingPoolAddress)) {
      return LendingPoolStatus.Expired;
    }

    if (
      _adapter.isLendingPoolLateWithinGracePeriod(
        _lendingPoolAddress,
        Constants.LATE_PAYMENT_GRACE_PERIOD_IN_DAYS
      )
    ) {
      return LendingPoolStatus.LateWithinGracePeriod;
    }

    if (_adapter.isLendingPoolLate(_lendingPoolAddress)) {
      return LendingPoolStatus.Late;
    }

    return LendingPoolStatus.Active;

```


Obviously for LendingPoolStatus.**Expired** to be returned, `GoldfinchAdapter.isLendingPoolExpired` must return true.


However, it only returns true if the termEndTime is in the past or (it's zero and creditline balance is zero). It doesn't check if the pool is shutdown due to emergency.

```sh
    return
      block.timestamp >= _termEndTimestamp ||
      (_termEndTimestamp > 0 && _creditLine.balance() == 0);
```

When a lending pool is shutdown in Goldfinch, 
- The pool is paused
- The pool balance is zero
- The creditline balance is zero

 `(_termEndTimestamp > 0 && _creditLine.balance() == 0)` condition normally will be true if the pool is shutdown. However, this can be bypassed by sending any amount of USDC (e.g.1 USDC) directly to the creditline. 
 This means if a pool is shutdown and **termEndTimestamp** is still in future, it will never be considered as expired in Carapace protocol till **termEndTimestamp** becomes in the past.


## Impact
- A lending pool that's shutdown by Goldfinch is still not expired in Carapace.
- It is **possible to buy or renew protection** for a lending pool that's shutdown.
- **Wrong assessment of the state** in DefaultStateManager and ReferenceLendingPools.

### Goldfinch

- Emergency Shutdown

```sh
  function emergencyShutdown() public onlyAdmin {
    if (!paused()) {
      pause();
    }

    IERC20withDec usdc = config.getUSDC();
    address reserveAddress = config.reserveAddress();
    // Sweep any funds to community reserve
    uint256 poolBalance = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
    if (poolBalance > 0) {
      config.getUSDC().safeERC20Transfer(reserveAddress, poolBalance);
    }

    uint256 clBalance = usdc.balanceOf(address(creditLine));
    if (clBalance > 0) {
      usdc.safeERC20TransferFrom(address(creditLine), reserveAddress, clBalance);
    }
    emit EmergencyShutdown(address(this));
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `GoldfinchAdapter.isLendingPoolExpired`, check if the pool is paused, if yes, always consider it expired regardless of any other checks.
