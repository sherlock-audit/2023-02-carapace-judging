# ProtectionPool can be moved to the next phase if leverage ratio is below the floor price

## Summary

The protection pool fundamentally operates by moving from phase to phase in order to ensure the pool moves through as a guarded launch. These phases include `OpenToSellers` where investment opportunity is open for protection sellers, `OpenToBuyers` where protection is available for purchase for buyers and `Open` where buyers can buy protection and sellers can deposit and withdraw funds.  

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the documentation, the condition for moving from `OpenToBuyers` to `Open` is that the leverage ratio must lie within the floor and ceiling price. For example, the check when calling `movePoolPhase()` only checks if the leverage ratio is below the ceiling but does not check that it is above the floor.

## Impact

It is possible that the pool may be moved to the `Open` phase prematurely.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended that the if condition in `movePoolphase()` is modified to reflect the following:
```solidity
uint256 leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();
if (leverageRatio <= poolInfo.params.leverageRatioCeiling && leverageRatio >= poolInfo.params.leverageRatioFloor) {
```
