# claimableAmount is not scaled and converted properly in ProtectionPool.sol#claimUnlockedCaptial

## Summary

claimableAmount is not scaled properly in ProtectionPool.sol#claimUnlockedCaptial

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation of the ProtectionPool, user can claim the unlocked Captial

```solidity
  /// @inheritdoc IProtectionPool
  function claimUnlockedCapital(address _receiver)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
  {
    /// Investors can claim their total share of released/unlocked capital across all lending pools
    uint256 _claimableAmount = defaultStateManager
      .calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital(msg.sender);

    if (_claimableAmount > 0) {
      console.log(
        "Total sToken underlying: %s, claimableAmount: %s",
        totalSTokenUnderlying,
        _claimableAmount
      );
      /// transfer the share of unlocked capital to the receiver
      poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, _claimableAmount);
    }
  }
```

which calls:

```solidity
 /// The claimable amount for the given seller is proportional to the seller's share of the total supply at the snapshot
  /// claimable amount = (seller's snapshot balance / total supply at snapshot) * locked capital amount
  _claimableUnlockedCapital =
    (_poolSToken.balanceOfAt(_seller, _snapshotId) *
      lockedCapital.amount) /
    _poolSToken.totalSupplyAt(_snapshotId);
```

note that the amount of poolSToken is used to calculate the _claimableUnlockedCapital, but it is the poolInfo.underlyingToken get transferred amount, we may need to convert the poolSToken balance to poolInfo.underlyingToken balance before transfer the token amount. because poolSToken is the share amount not the underlying token amount just like the comment suggested:

```solidity
/// transfer the share of unlocked capital to the receiver
poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, _claimableAmount);
```

the PoolSToken is 18 deciamls, but the poolInfo.underlyingToken could be USDC, which is 6 decimals. The mis-matching between decimals can break the accounting of the claimUnlockedCaptial and lock fund if the underlying token is USDC or user may just over-claim the USDC amount.

## Impact

Mismatched underlying token precision breaks claimUnlockedCaptial accounting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol convert the PoolSToken amount to poolInfo.underlyingToken amount properly before letting user claim the unlocked captial.

The protocol may want to use this function below to complete the conversion.

```solidity
  /// @inheritdoc IProtectionPool
  function convertToUnderlying(uint256 _sTokenShares)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    return
      ProtectionPoolHelper.scale18DecimalsAmtToUnderlyingDecimals(
        ((_sTokenShares * _getExchangeRate()) / Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS), /// underlying amount in 18 decimals
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );
  }
```
