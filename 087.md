# Unable to withdraw the ETH locked in the contract

## Summary
Unable to withdraw the ETH locked in the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
In order to save gas, many functions use the payable keyword, so it is very likely that users will send ETH to the contract, but the contract does not provide any function that can extract ETH.


like
```solidity
contracts/core/ContractFactory.sol:
  120      string calldata _symbol
  121:   ) external payable onlyOwner {
  122      /// Create a proxy contract for the protection pool using specified implementation.

  182      address _lendingProtocolAdapterFactory
  183:   ) external payable onlyOwner {
  184      /// Create a ERC1967 proxy contract for the reference lending pools using specified implementation address.


  217:   ) external payable onlyOwner {
  218      _createLendingProtocolAdapter(
```
