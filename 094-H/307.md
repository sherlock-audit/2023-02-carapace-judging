# Protection pool SToken exchange rate is vulnerable to manipulation

## Summary

Protection pool SToken exchange rate is vulnerable to manipulation

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, the exchange rate is implemented below:

```solidity
  function _getExchangeRate() internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _totalScaledCapital = ProtectionPoolHelper
      .scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
        totalSTokenUnderlying,
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );
    uint256 _totalSTokenSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 _exchangeRate = (_totalScaledCapital *
      Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _totalSTokenSupply;

    console.log(
      "Total capital: %s, Total SToken Supply: %s, exchange rate: %s",
      _totalScaledCapital,
      _totalSTokenSupply,
      _exchangeRate
    );

    return _exchangeRate;
  }
```

To manipulate to exchange rate, the user first needs to he can withdraw any amount in an under cycle by leveraging the technique in this report:

The user can buy a Lending pool Position NFT, and deposit large amount of underlying tokens to inflate the _totalScaledCapital and inflate the exchange, then user can call withdraw and use SToken in exchange for the underlying asset in high exchange rate.

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol not using the spot totalSupply and total underlying token to derive the exchange rate.
