# Protection can be bought in late pools, allowing buyers to pay minimal premium and increase the chance of a compensation

## Summary
A buyer can buy a protection for a pool that's already late on a payment. The buyer can pay the minimal premium and get a higher chance of getting a compensation. Protection sellers may bear higher losses due to reduced premium amounts and the increased chance of protection payments.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows lenders on Goldfinch to get an insurance on the funds they lent. The insurance is paid after [a repayment was late](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L324-L335). The protocol [doesn't allow protection buyers to buy protections for pools that's already late](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L407-L435) to disallow buyers abusing the protections payment mechanism. To do this, the `_verifyLendingPoolIsActive` function [checks the current status of a pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L412-L415) and [reverts if it's late](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L421-L426).

However, `poolStatus` is cached and can be outdated when the function is called, since it's not updated in the call. Pool statuses are updated in [assessStates](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L119) and [assessStateBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L137), which are triggered on schedule separately. This allows buyers to buy protections in pools that's already late in Goldfinch but still active in Carapace.

Consider this scenario:
1. A pool is in the active state after `assessStates` is run.
1. Before the next `assessStates` call, the pool gets into the late state, due to a missed repayment. However, in the protocol, the pool is still in the active state since `assessStates` hasn't been called.
1. The malicious buyer front runts the next `assessStates` call and submits their transactions that buys a protection with the minimal duration for the pool. The `_verifyLendingPoolIsActive` function passes because the pool's state hasn't been updated in the contracts yet.
1. The `assessStates` call changes the status of the pool to `LateWithinGracePeriod`, which disallows buying protections for the pool.
1. If the pool eventually gets into the default state (chances of that is higher since there's already a late payment), the malicious buyer will be eligible for a compensation.
## Impact
Protection buyers can increase their chances of getting a compensation, while buying protections with the minimal duration and paying the minimal premium. Protection sellers will bear increased loses due to reduced premium amounts and the increased chance of a compensation.
## Code Snippet
1. `_verifyLendingPoolIsActive` checks the current status of a pool and reverts if it's not active:
[ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L412-L415](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L412-L415)
1. Pool statuses are cached and are stored in `DefaultStateManager`:
[DefaultStateManager.sol#L278-L280](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L278-L280)
1. Pool statuses are updated in `DefaultStateManager.assessStates`:
[DefaultStateManager.sol#L119](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L119)
1. `DefaultStateManager.assessStates` is not called by `ProtectionPool.buyProtection`:
[ProtectionPool.sol#L162](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L162)
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
In `ProtectionPoolHelper._verifyLendingPoolIsActive`, consider calling `DefaultStateManager._assessState` to update the status of the pool for which a protection is bought.
