# Claimable amount for all locked capital in a lending pool only return latest snapshot and wrong total claimable amount

## Summary

In protocol, sellers can call `claimUnlockedCapital()` in `ProtectionPool.sol` which `DefaultStateManager.sol` will go through all locked capital of the lending pool and return a calculated `ClaimableAmount` for `ProtectionPool` to send back to user and cache latest claimable `snapshotId` for future claim.

## Vulnerability Detail

`DefaultStateManager._calculateClaimableAmount()` supposed to aggregate all not yet claimed locked capital of single lending pool, but it only return latest locked capital.

## Impact

If a lending pool is late twice and repaid twice for late period, and seller not claim unlocked capital both of the time.
Then, seller lose fund when receiving only latest locked capital and missing out the first late period locked fund.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L502-L506

`_claimableUnlockedCapital` calculated in a loop to calculate total claimable amount, yet the value was override instead of aggregate

```js
File: contracts\core\DefaultStateManager.sol
500:         /// The claimable amount for the given seller is proportional to the seller's share of the total supply at the snapshot
501:         /// claimable amount = (seller's snapshot balance / total supply at snapshot) * locked capital amount
502:         _claimableUnlockedCapital =
503:           (_poolSToken.balanceOfAt(_seller, _snapshotId) *
504:             lockedCapital.amount) / 
505:           _poolSToken.totalSupplyAt(_snapshotId);
506: 
507:         /// Update the last claimed snapshot id for the seller
508:         _latestClaimedSnapshotId = _snapshotId;
```

The function above was called from [`ProtectionPool.claimUnlockedCapital()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L427) to get locked capital when pool go into late phase

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `_claimableUnlockedCapital =` formular should change to `_claimableUnlockedCapital +=` inside for-loop.
