# Reentrancy attack in the calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital function.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
If an external function is called after the `calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital` function has calculated the locked capital, but before it is claimed, it is possible for an attacker to re-enter the function and claim the same capital twice.

The issue arises because the `_calculateClaimableAmount` function called by the `calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital` function can be re-entered by an attacker, this function calculates the claimable amount across all the locked capital instances for a given protection pool, suppose an attacker calls an external function after the locked capital has been calculated but before it is claimed. In that case, the attacker can re-enter the function and claim the same capital twice.

## Impact
It allows an attacker to steal the unlocked capital from the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `nonReentrant` modifier before the function declaration, this would prevent reentrancy attacks and ensure that capital is only claimed once, a nonReentrant modifier.

Implementation.
```solidity
// Prevents a contract from calling itself, directly or indirectly.
// If you mark a function `nonReentrant`, you should also
// mark it `external`.
modifier nonReentrant() {
  // On the first call to nonReentrant, _notEntered will be true
  require(_notEntered, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");

  // Any calls to nonReentrant after this point will fail
  _notEntered = false;

  _;

  // By storing the original value once again, a refund is triggered
  _notEntered = true;
}
```
After adding the nonReentrant modifier to the vulnerable function.

```solidity
function calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital(address _seller)
    external
    override
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 _claimedUnlockedCapital)
  {
    ...
  }
```
