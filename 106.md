# Docs says that early depositors/protection buyers are rewarded with CARA tokens, but it's not like that

## Summary
Docs says that early depositors/protection buyers are rewarded with CARA tokens, but it's not like that
## Vulnerability Detail
From the docs.
https://www.carapace.finance/docs/protocol-mechanics/protection_sellers#cara-token-rewards
> Early protection sellers are rewarded with our protocol token. They can invest their CARA tokens in decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to earn more yields.

The same is said about early protection buyers.
However nowhere in the code there is nothing about that.
## Impact
Early depositors/protection buyers do not receive rewards
## Code Snippet
No code here.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reward them as said in docs.
