# Users can deposit when cycle is locked.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IProtectionPoolCycleManager.sol#L4-L9

Comments say that when the cycle states locked, the cycle is in progress & locked for deposit & withdraw.

But deposit() only checks poolInfo.currentPhase. It's not checking if the pool cycle is locked or not.
## Impact
Users can deposit in the locked state.

deposit() needs to have whenPoolIsOpen() modifier.
