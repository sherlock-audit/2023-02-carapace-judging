# User can loose Stoken without receiving underlying token when withdrawing small Stoken shares.

## Summary
User can loose Stoken without receiving underlying token when withdrawing small Stoken shares due
to the function `convertToUnderlying` might return 0 if `_sTokenShares` is small enough, and also because
function `withdraw` does not check if `_underlyingAmountToTransfer` (result from `convertToUnderlying`) > 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, the `convertToUnderlying` is implemented as below:
```solidity
function convertToUnderlying(uint256 _sTokenShares)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    return
      ProtectionPoolHelper.scale18DecimalsAmtToUnderlyingDecimals(
        ((_sTokenShares * _getExchangeRate()) / Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS), /// underlying amount in 18 decimals
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );
  }

function scale18DecimalsAmtToUnderlyingDecimals(
    uint256 amt,
    uint256 _targetDecimals
  ) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return (amt * 10**_targetDecimals) / Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS;
  }
```

in function `scale18DecimalsAmtToUnderlyingDecimals`, if the `amt` is small enough, the return value would be 0.

Below is the POC for this, to not break any test case, replace the this test case in file `ProtectionPool.test.ts`
```solidity
it("...is successful for 1st seller", async () => {
          // Seller has requested 10K sTokens in previous cycle
          const withdrawalAmt = parseEther("10000");
          await verifyWithdrawal(seller, withdrawalAmt);
        });
```

with POC

```typescript
it("...when user withdraw small token shares, their share are burnt accordingly but they dont receive underlying token",
            async () => {
              // Seller has requested 10K sTokens in previous cycle
              const _sellerSTokenBalanceBefore = await protectionPool.balanceOf(sellerAddress);
              const _sellerUSDCBalanceBefore = await USDC.balanceOf(sellerAddress);
              console.log(`Before: ${_sellerSTokenBalanceBefore} ${_sellerUSDCBalanceBefore}`);

              const withdrawalAmt = parseUSDC("10000");

              await expect(
                  protectionPool
                      .connect(seller)
                      .withdraw(withdrawalAmt, sellerAddress)
              )
                  .to.emit(protectionPool, "WithdrawalMade")
                  .withArgs(sellerAddress, withdrawalAmt, sellerAddress);

              const _sellerSTokenBalanceAfter = await protectionPool.balanceOf(sellerAddress);
              const _sellerUSDCBalanceAfter = await USDC.balanceOf(sellerAddress);
              // Seller Stoken balance decreases
              expect(_sellerSTokenBalanceAfter).to.eq(_sellerSTokenBalanceBefore.sub(withdrawalAmt));
              // Yet their usdc does not increase
              expect(_sellerUSDCBalanceAfter).to.eq(_sellerUSDCBalanceBefore);

              console.log(`After: ${_sellerSTokenBalanceAfter} ${_sellerUSDCBalanceAfter}`);

        });
        it("...is successful for 1st seller", async () => {
          // Seller has requested 10K sTokens in previous cycle
          const withdrawalAmt = parseEther("10000").sub(parseUSDC("10000"));
          await verifyWithdrawal(seller, withdrawalAmt);
        });
```

In the first test case, the code withdraws 10^11 amount of Stoken, the Stoken balance is deducted accordingly,
but USDC balance remains the same.

The second test case, I changed the `withdrawalAmt` to `parseEther("10000").sub(parseUSDC("10000"))` since the 1st test case already withdraws `parseUSDC("10000")` amount of SToken, in order to pass this test case and not to break anything.


## Impact
User may loose their token shares without receiving underlying token when call `withdraw`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend only proceed with withdraw if the result of `convertToUnderlying` > 0.
