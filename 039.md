# requestWithdrawal()  lack of refresh pool cycle  before get cycle index

## Summary

requestWithdrawal()  lack of refresh pool cycle  before get cycle index, use may withdraw() at 2 cycle

## Vulnerability Detail

Users may submit withdrawal requests via requestWithdrawal(), which is currently restricted by protocol to actual withdrawals during the open period of the third cycle after 2 cycles
code:
```solidity
  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }
    /// Get current cycle index for this pool
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(  //@<------------- not call poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState first 
      address(this)
    );

    /// Actual withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle after next cycle
    /// For example: if request is made in at some time in cycle 1,
    /// then withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 3
    uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;

    WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
      _withdrawalCycleIndex
    ];

    /// Cache existing requested amount for the cycle for the sender
    uint256 _oldRequestAmount = withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender];
    withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender] = _sTokenAmount;
```

The current implementation is a direct call to getCurrentCycleIndex() 
CalculateAndSetPoolCycleState() is not called first, so the cycle may be old because the bot maybe has not yet executed the poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState()

It is recommended to execute calculateAndSetPoolCycleState() first and then execute getCurrentCycleIndex()

## Impact
can withdraw() at 2 cycle

## Recommendation

```solidity
  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }
+   poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState(address(this));

    /// Get current cycle index for this pool
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );
```
