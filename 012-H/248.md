# Withdrawals locking can be bypassed, potentially disrupting the supply and demand balance

## Summary
Protection sellers may abuse the withdrawals requesting mechanism to enable withdrawals in future cycles: they'll be able to deposit and withdraw capital in the same cycle. Protection sellers may use this opportunity to remove funds before a pool defaults and funds are locked to pay compensations. In the worst case, when exploited by a majority of sellers or big sellers, the risk factor and premium can skyrocket, breaking the core economical mechanism.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protection pool implements a two-step withdrawal process:
1. first, protection sellers need to call the [requestWithdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L208) function to request a withdrawal of a certain amount in a future cycle;
1. then, when the future cycle is in the open period, protection sellers need to call the [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L226) to get the amount they requested earlier.

Funds deposited by protection sellers are locked in the protection pool [until the open period of the cycle that's after the next cycle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1072-L1075). This keeps protection sellers from reducing their loses (and compensations to protection buyers) by withdrawing funds before pools default. This also stabilizes the premium price (which is "an aggregated view of supply and demand in the market", as per the whitepaper) since timed capital withdrawals can skew the leverage ratio of a pool, increase the risk factor and the premium price.

However, the two-step withdrawal mechanism can be abused to allow unlimited deposits and withdrawals in any future cycle. Consider this scenario:
1. Current cycle index is 1. A seller deposits funds into the protection pool to earn passive income.
1. The seller immediately requests withdrawal of all their funds. The funds can be withdrawn in cycle 3 ([current cycle index + 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1075)). At this step, the seller can even take a flash loan to [inflate their sToken balance and increase the limit of tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1062-L1065) they can withdrawâ€“this will let them deposit and withdraw funds multiple times since the limit wil be higher than the actual amount of funds they own.
1. In cycle 2, the seller requests withdrawal of all their funds again, unlocking them in cycle 4. At this point, the [withdrawalCycleDetails](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1077-L1094) mapping contains two records: one for cycle 3 and one for cycle 4.
1. In cycle 3, the seller withdraws their funds. The amounts are [subtracted from the cycle 3 record in the `withdrawalCycleDetails` mapping](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L265-L266). However, the cycle 4 record is still in the mapping.
1. In cycle 4, the seller can deposit funds and withdraw them at any time during the open period of the cycle. This allows them to earn yield in the cycle and quit before there's a defaulted pool or before the open period ends, to avoid locking of their funds.

Using flash loans, the seller doesn't even need to have funds deposited in the protection pool in the first place to be able to request withdrawal, which makes this exploit scenario even less riskier and cheaper for sellers.
## Impact
Since protection sellers are financially incentivized to abuse the withdrawals mechanism (they want to earn yield without being exposed to the risk of paying compensations to protection buyers), protection pools may experience high liquidity swings during open periods of cycles. Protection sellers may time pool status updates (`assessStates` function calls) and remove all their funds when a pool has a late payment, to avoid paying protections. In such scenarios protection buyers can get underpaid: a protection pool might have not enough funds to pay out a protection.

In the worst case scenario, protection sellers may deposit liquidity in the beginning of the open period of a cycle and withdraw all liquidity at the end of the open period of the cycle, to avoid the risk of protection payments during the locked period. They may repeat this in each cycle to earn yield and void paying protections.

Protection buyers, on the other hand, may suffer financial loses: reduced capital (potentially, 0 capital in a protection pool) will reduce the leverage ratio and will increase the premium paid by protection buyers.

## Recommendation
Consider disallowing withdrawing in the current cycle to a seller after they have deposited funds, no matter if there's a requested withdrawal in the current cycle. One way this can be achieved is by reducing the requested withdrawal amount by the amount of deposited tokens. However, since requested withdrawal amount can be inflated by flash loaned sTokens, this doesn't seem reliable. A more reliable solution seems setting the current cycle's withdrawal request of a depositor to 0, so that no withdrawals are allowed in the current cycle after a deposit was made.
