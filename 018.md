# accruePremiumAndExpireProtections is vulnerable to DDoS

## Summary
accruePremiumAndExpireProtections is vulnerable to DDoS

## Vulnerability Detail
When buying a protection, the protection is pushed to `protectionInfos` array and the  `_protectionIndex` is added to `activeProtectionIndexes` of both the lending pool and the buyer account:

```sh
uint256 _protectionIndex = protectionInfos.length - 1;
    lendingPoolDetail.activeProtectionIndexes.add(_protectionIndex);
    protectionBuyerAccounts[msg.sender].activeProtectionIndexes.add(
      _protectionIndex
    );
```

`accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` function loops over the passed lending pools (or all if nothing passed), and for each pool it loops over all its active protections by calling `_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` function. 

```sh
 /// Get all active protection indexes for the lending pool
    uint256[] memory _protectionIndexes = lendingPoolDetail
      .activeProtectionIndexes
      .values();

    /// Iterate through all active protection indexes for the lending pool
    uint256 _length = _protectionIndexes.length;
    for (uint256 j; j < _length; ) {
```

There is a potential risk that the `activeProtectionIndexes` (EnumerableSetUpgradeable.UintSet) may naturally grow large which makes the function `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` unusable/uncallable due to gas limits.

Moreover, a malicious actor (a lender) could buy multiple protections with tiny amounts to let the set grow enough to cause the risk mentioned above.

In general and as you notice, the function `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` is a bit expensive (in term of gas). Thus, the issue is likely to happen.
## Impact
`accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` becomes unusable/uncallable due to gas limits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider adding an upper limit of buyProtection for the same buyer (or  _nftLpTokenId).
- Optimise the function to consume less gas.
