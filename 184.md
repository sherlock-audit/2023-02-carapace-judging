# Protection can be bought unlimited number of times for the same loan

## Summary
Protection buyer can purchase protection several times for the same loan. This can lead to unexpected behaviour or bypassing protection size limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
When protection is being purchased, it is enforced that protection amount is less than the principal worth
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ReferenceLendingPools.sol#L161-L167

However, the code doesn't keep track of whether this loan represented by `nftLpTokenId` has already been used. Therefore, it is possible to buy purchase protection several times for the same loan.

The protocol doesn't support this. For example, if two protections were purchased for the same loan, it will not be possible to renew both of them as expired protections are grouped by NFT id

It is unclear how protection payouts will be handled in such a scenario. If only one payout per NFT is to be made, then `lockCapital` will lock more funds than needed as it will go through the same NFT twice

## Impact
Protocol may enter an unexpected state with several active protections covering the same loan

## Code Snippet
This PoC adds 3 protections for the same loan. Total protection amount exceeds loan value

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep track of NFTs that have been used for protection. Don't allow to buy second protection per NFT
