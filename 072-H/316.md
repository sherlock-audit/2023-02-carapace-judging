# ProtectionPool.sol : `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` should not be called when ProtectionPool is in paused state

## Summary
In protection pool contract, deposit, withdraw and all other transactional related functions are called with certain predefined conditions. One of such condition is `WhenNotPaused`.
But premium accrual is taking by considering this idle period too to calculate the premium and expire.

## Vulnerability Detail

[accruePremiumAndExpireProtections](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L279) is pubic and can be called by anyone.
It does not have `whenNotPaused` that means it can be called even when the protection pool core transaction related functionalities are paused such as deposit , withdraw and so.

## Impact

Idle state is considered as valid period and allowed to accrue premium.
