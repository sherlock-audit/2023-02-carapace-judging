# [M-02] Centralisation Vulnerability

## Summary

Users aren't able to withdraw their funds in a specific scenario.

## Vulnerability Detail

Centralization issue

## Impact

It's a centralization vulnerability if an owner can pause not only inbound but outbound functionality. It should be able to pause inbound functionality like `deposit` but not outbound methods like `requestWithdrawal`, `withdraw`, and `claimUnlockedCapital`. This will lead to locked users' funds with no way to withdraw them or request a withdrawal.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
208: function requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount)

226: function withdraw(uint256 _sTokenWithdrawalAmount, address _receiver)

427: function claimUnlockedCapital(address _receiver)
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Since `requestWithdrawal`, `withdraw`, and `claimUnlockedCapital` are outbound methods and shouldn't be pausable, remove their `whenNotPaused()` modifiers.
