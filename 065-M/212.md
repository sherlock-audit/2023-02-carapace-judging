# [H] - totalSTokenUnderlying is not updated in claimUnlockedCapital and _verifyAndCreateProtection functions

## Summary

The functions `claimUnlockedCapital` and `_verifyAndCreateProtection`  transfers the underlying token to the receiver and to the pool respectively. But it fails to update the `totalSTokenUnderlying` variable.

This can probably cause a lot of problems since `totalSTokenUnderlying` is being used for calculations in a lot of places

## Vulnerability Detail

Below is the code that is used for claiming unlocked capital for investors and as you can see the `totalSTokenUnderlying` is not being reduced here before it is sent to the investor.

```solidity
function claimUnlockedCapital(address _receiver)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
  {
    /// Investors can claim their total share of released/unlocked capital across all lending pools
    uint256 _claimableAmount = defaultStateManager
      .calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital(msg.sender);

    if (_claimableAmount > 0) {
      /// transfer the share of unlocked capital to the receiver
      poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, _claimableAmount);
    }
  }
```

Let’s confirm this with a simple test

```tsx
it("...the totalSTokenUnderlying will be equal before and after claiming", async () => {
          const _totalBefore = (await protectionPool.getPoolDetails())[0];
          expect(await claimAndVerifyUnlockedCapital(seller, true)).to.be.gt(0);
          const _totalAfter = (await protectionPool.getPoolDetails())[0];
          expect(_totalBefore).to.eq(_totalAfter)
        });
```

The same problem occurs in `_verifyAndCreateProtection` function as well. but this time the `totalSTokenUnderlying` is not being incremented since the token is being transferred to the pool.

## Impact

The impact can be huge because the `totalSTokenUnderlying` is being used by many functions to calculate a lot of things. Some of the functions that may be affected by this are-

- ProtectionPool.sol → calculateLeverageRatio()
- ProtectionPoolHelper.sol → calculateProtectionPremium()
- ProtectionPoolHelper.sol → calculateAndTrackPremium()
- ProtectionPool.sol → accruePremiumAndExpireProtections()
- ProtectionPool.sol → lockCapital()
- ProtectionPool.sol → _hasMinRequiredCapital()
- ProtectionPool.sol → _getExchangeRate()

## Tools Used

Manual, Hardhat

## Recommendation

Add the below in `claimUnlockedCapital` before safeTransfer

```jsx
totalSTokenUnderlying -= _claimableAmount;
```

And the below in `_verifyAndCreateProtection`
