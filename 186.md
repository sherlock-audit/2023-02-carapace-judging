# User can bypass the `ProtectionPurchaseLimitTimestamp` restriction that disallows protection purchase on a specific lending pool after specific time elapses

## Summary
Protocol imposes a purchase deadline that disallows protection buyers from adding new protection beyond this deadline. Only exception to this rule is old protection buyers who are renewing their purchase - this loophole can be exploited by a malicious user to bypass the time limit.

A protection buyer can start by buying a negligible amount of protection & keep renewing such negligible amount until time limit expires. After expiry, a protection buyer can always increase the protection amount when executing a fresh renewal request. There is no check currently to verify if the protection amount on expired protection is the same as (or greater than) protection amount in renewal request.

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a new protection purchase, [`canBuyProtection`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ReferenceLendingPools.sol#L153) verifies if current timestamp exceeds the `lendingPoolInfo.protectionPurchaseLimitTimestamp`. Only exception to this check is when an existing user is renewing protection

```solidity
  function canBuyProtection(
    address _buyer,
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _purchaseParams,
    bool _isRenewal
  )
  {
    ...
        /// When buyer is not renewing the existing protection and
    /// the protection purchase is NOT within purchase limit duration after
    /// a lending pool added, the buyer cannot purchase protection.
    /// i.e. if the purchase limit is 90 days, the buyer cannot purchase protection
    /// after 90 days of lending pool added to the basket
    if (
      !_isRenewal &&
      block.timestamp > lendingPoolInfo.protectionPurchaseLimitTimestamp
    ) {
      return false;
    }
    ...
  }
```
[`verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L384) function in `ProtectionHelper` library is responsible for checking if existing buyer holds the same NFT token for same lending pool as expired protection. Note that there is no check in this function to verify if the new requested protection amount is equal (or less than) protection amount of expired protection.

```solidity

  function verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection(
    mapping(address => ProtectionBuyerAccount) storage protectionBuyerAccounts,
    ProtectionInfo[] storage protectionInfos,
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _renewalGracePeriodInSeconds
  ) external view {
    ...
    if (
      expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress ==
      _protectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress &&
      expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId ==
      _protectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
    ) {
      /// If we are NOT within grace period after the protection is expired, then revert
      if (
        block.timestamp >
        (expiredProtectionInfo.startTimestamp +
          expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.protectionDurationInSeconds +
          _renewalGracePeriodInSeconds)
      ) {
        revert IProtectionPool.CanNotRenewProtectionAfterGracePeriod();
      }
    }
    ...
    }

```

Combining above 2, a malicious user can start off with a very small amount of protection and keep renewing the same within grace period. And when the time comes, she can always increase protection amount. This way a buyer bypasses any time limit restriction imposed by protocol

## Impact

A protection buyer should not be allowed to increase his protection on renewal - at best, she should be able to continue with same protection as before. By starting small, a protection buyer retains an option to increase protection amount well beyond purchase time limit. Such limit exists to protect protection sellers - bypassing this limit would mean potential losses to protection sellers

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Inside the `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection` , in addition to checking `lendingPoolAddress` and `nftLpTokenId`, I recommend that an additional check to be done to verify that protection amount for renewal request is the same (or less than) protection amount of expired protection.

Recommend following change to `if` condition on line 384

```solidity
    if (
      expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress ==
      _protectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress &&
      expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId ==
      _protectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId &&
      expiredProtectionPurchaseParams.protectionAmount >=
      _protectionPurchaseParams.protectionAmount        //---audit - add this condition on protection amount
    ) {
        ...
    }
```
