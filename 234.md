# # [M-03] The protection buyer could manipulate the leverage ratio to buy protection at cheap premium

## Summary

The protection buyer could manipulate the protocol leverage ratio to buy protection at cheaper premium despite of high risk lending pool.

## Vulnerability Details

From the premium calculation, the higher the leverage ratio is, the lower the risk factor and the premium. And basing on the curvature graph, for example at curvature 0.05, the risk premium decreases from more than 50% to about 5% significantly when the leverage ratio decreases from 0.3 to 0.6.

Before purchasing the protection, the buyer can manipulate the leverage ratio by deposit a very large amount to the protection pool (call `depositAndRequestWithdrawal`) to increase the leverage ratio (below the ceiling leverage). It helps driving down the premium. He then purchase the protection at cheaper price. After that, he withdraw the deposited amount.

## Impact

The protection buyer could manipulate the protocol to buy protection at cheaper premium despite of high risk lending pool.

## Recommendation

Update the applied leverage ratio using to calculate premium to change gradually by time instead of relying on `total capital` and `total protection` which can be changed instantly by protocol users.
