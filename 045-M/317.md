# Locking mechanism increase risk of insolvency when pools are re-activated

## Summary

When a lenderpool is turned from active->late/lateWithGracePeriod underlying capital is locked and can not be used for other default payments nor can it be withdrawn, the capital is locked for a minimum of 2 payment terms. If a pool is re-activated the capital will still be locked and can not be used for default payments for the remaining time. Even the lenderpool that the capital was locked to protect can not access those funds if they are turned from Active -> late/lateWithGracePeriod again.

## Vulnerability Detail

The locking mechanism was designed to block sellers from leaving when the risk increases and to earmark the amount needed to cover a potential default. The capital that is locked is both inaccessible for withdrawals but it also not be used for other cover other default payments since it is deducted from `totalSTokenUnderlying`. See this code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L413-L423

The issue is that if a lenderpool is turned Active again due to a payment the capital remains inaccessible for default payments until the full 2 payment terms have passed. The same lenderpool that the capital was locked to protect can not even access those funds. 

This means that the previously locked amount is not available if 2 payment period have not passed.

## Impact

When a lendingpool goes through the state changes Active-> late/lateWithGracePeriod -> Active we end up in a position where the risk of insolvency is HIGHER than before (all else equal) and not lower since `totalSTokenUnderlying` has decreased. The capital that was earmarked to cover this lendingpools default payments can not be used to cover any defaults for the until 2 payment terms have passed.

The locking mechanism increases the risk of insolvency rather than decreasing it whenever pools are re-activated.

Manual Review, vscode, foundry

## Recommendation

When a lenderpool is re-activated the amount locked should be put back into `totalSTokenUnderlying` so that it can be used for default payments again.

A re-activation event is still a signal of increased risk since a payment was missed. I will propose a change where carapace can specify how much of a risk this is and stop sellers from withdrawing an appropriate amount.

It is still possible to block a certain amount from leaving while not removing it from the `totalSTokenUnderlying`. This can be done by adding a new variable `lockedPercentage` to the `WithdrawalCycleDetail` struct such that the `withdrawlCycleDetails` mapping holds information of how much of the requested withdrawal is locked for each cycle. When a seller withdraws the `lockedPercentage` variable is used to decrease the possible withdrawal amount. 

An additional parameter can be added and adjusted by the carapace team that governs how much has to be stopped from leaving the protocol when lenderpools are re-activated. 

A more fine-grained solution is also possible where the parameter that governs how much should be locked is based on how long it took for the lenderpool to be re-activated. E.g. a missed payment by 2 days could only lock up 2/(2 payment terms) while a missed payment that pays on the final day locks up ~ 100% of the protection amount. In this case a  `lockedRatio` variable can be added to the `WithdrawlCycleDetails` struct.
