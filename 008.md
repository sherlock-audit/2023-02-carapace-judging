# A lender could possibly buy protection coverage for non-lent principal amount

## Summary
A lender could possibly buy protection coverage for non-lent principal amount or at least higher than the lent principal amount 

## Vulnerability Detail
When a lender buys a protection, the remaining principle amount is calculated by `GoldfinchAdapter.calculateRemainingPrincipal()` function, then  `ReferenceLendingPools.canBuyProtection()` function verifies that protection amount is less than or equal to the remaining principal.

The `calculateRemainingPrincipal()` function:
1. verifies that the lender owns the NFT (_nftLpTokenId)
2. verifies the NFT is junior tranche
3. calculates the remaining principle amount as follows:
```sh
_principalRemaining = _tokenInfo.principalAmount - _tokenInfo.principalRedeemed;
```

However, it doesn't check if the tranche has not been locked, and if so, the principalRedeemed must be greater than zero. If the tranche is not locked and principalRedeemed is zero, the lender can withdraw (not redeem)  his/her principal amount from GoldFinch's lending pool.


## Impact
Imagine this scenario:
1. The lender deposits into the lending pool, and doesn't redeem.
2. buys protection when the tranche is not locked yet.
3. Withdraws his/her principal amount from the lending pool.

This way, the lender has protection coverage for non-lent principal amount or at least higher than the lent principal amount if the withdrawal was partial.



## Code Snippet
### **Carapace** protocol

- `ReferenceLendingPools.canBuyProtection()`

```sh
    return
      _purchaseParams.protectionAmount <=
      calculateRemainingPrincipal(
        _purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress,
        _buyer,
        _purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
      );
```

- `GoldfinchAdapter.calculateRemainingPrincipal()`

```sh
    if (_poolTokens.ownerOf(_nftLpTokenId) == _lender) {
      IPoolTokens.TokenInfo memory _tokenInfo = _poolTokens.getTokenInfo(
        _nftLpTokenId
      );

      /// If the token is for the specified lending pool and is a junior tranche, then calculate the remaining principal
      /// otherwise, the remaining principal is zero
      /// Only junior tranche is allowed to have protection coverage
      if (
        _tokenInfo.pool == _lendingPoolAddress &&
        _isJuniorTrancheId(_tokenInfo.tranche)
      ) {
        _principalRemaining =
          _tokenInfo.principalAmount -
          _tokenInfo.principalRedeemed;
      }
    }
```

----
### **Goldfinch**'s lending pool 

- `TranchedPool.withdraw() => internal _withdraw()`
This is where the lender can withdraw his/her deposited amount

```sh
    if (trancheInfo.lockedUntil == 0) {
      trancheInfo.principalDeposited = trancheInfo.principalDeposited.sub(amount);

      principalToRedeem = amount;

      config.getPoolTokens().withdrawPrincipal(tokenId, principalToRedeem);

```

- `PoolTokens.withdrawPrincipal()`
	This is called by TranchedPool when the lender withdraws (check above)
```sh
   require(token.principalRedeemed == 0, "Token redeemed");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


In `calculateRemainingPrincipal`, check if the **tranche is locked**, if it's not yet, then the **principalRedeemed** must be **zero**. otherwise, return zero so that the lender can not buy a protection.
