# user may not be able to renewProtection()  properly within protectionRenewalGracePeriodInSeconds

## Summary

user may not be able to renewProtection()  properly within protectionRenewalGracePeriodInSeconds

## Vulnerability Detail

Users can call renewProtection to buy protection, renew will reduce the limit, e.g.:_minProtectionDurationInSeconds can be only one day 
but need to meet certain conditions, such as the need not to expire too long, not greater than the protectionRenewalGracePeriodInSeconds

The expiration time is set in
_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections() ->expireProtection()
The code is as follows:
```solidity
  function _accruePremiumAndExpireProtections(
    LendingPoolDetail storage lendingPoolDetail,
    uint256 _lastPremiumAccrualTimestamp,
    uint256 _latestPaymentTimestamp
  )
    internal
    returns (
      uint256 _accruedPremiumForLendingPool,
      uint256 _totalProtectionRemoved
    )
  {
...
      if (_expired) {
        /// Add removed protection amount to the total protection removed
        _totalProtectionRemoved += protectionInfo
          .purchaseParams
          .protectionAmount;

        ProtectionPoolHelper.expireProtection(
          protectionBuyerAccounts,
          protectionInfo,
          lendingPoolDetail,
          _protectionIndex
        );

```
```solidity
  function expireProtection(
    mapping(address => ProtectionBuyerAccount) storage protectionBuyerAccounts,
    ProtectionInfo storage protectionInfo,
    LendingPoolDetail storage lendingPoolDetail,
    uint256 _protectionIndex
  ) public {
...
    buyerAccount.expiredProtectionIndexByLendingPool[
      purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress
    ][purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId] = _protectionIndex;
```

From the above code we can see the general logic:
loop activeProtectionIndexes , and set buyerAccount.expiredProtectionIndexByLendingPool[
][nftLpTokenId] = last _protectionIndex

Suppose there are two Protections for the same NFT, both expired, the last one will overwrite the first one

There is a problem: the order of activeProtectionIndexes is not sorted by expiration time, which will result in the last one not necessarily being the one with the maximum expiration time

Example:
alice has two protection (same NFTID):
activeProtectionIndexes[0]= {  expirationTimestamp = 23:00 } 
activeProtectionIndexes[1]= {  expirationTimestamp = 01 :00 } 
(This is possible, the difference start time and duration,and there is no restriction that the same NFT can only buy a protection, user supplemental insurance is also reasonable)

when bot call accruePremiumAndExpireProtections(),will set buyerAccount.expiredProtectionIndexByLendingPool[
][nftLpTokenId] = 01 :00

This results in users who may be legal for the protectionRenewalGracePeriodInSeconds, but cannot buy

It is recommended that if the last set protection's expired time is greater than the current one, and not set to current

## Impact

user may not be able to renewProtection()  properly within protectionRenewalGracePeriodInSeconds
