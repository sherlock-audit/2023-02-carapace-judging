# ProtectionPool phase can move from OpenToBuyers to Open phase with no totalptotection

## Summary
If protection pool is in OpenToBuyers phase and still there is no totalprotection it can move to next phase ( open phase ) and also during open phase leverageRatio can be higher than the ceiling . 
## Vulnerability Detail
during move from OpenToBuyers to Open phase movePoolPhase() checks that leverageRatio is lower than ceiling which means enough buyers bought protection but if still nobody have been buy any protection and totalprotection is zero it passes the leverage ratio check because if totalprotection is zero _calculateLeverageRation() returns zero and it will pass the check . 
## Impact
ProtectionPool opens with zero total protection and leverageRatio will be higher than ceiling until enough buyers buy protection .

## Recommendation
You can add check to ensure that leverageRatio is not zero .
