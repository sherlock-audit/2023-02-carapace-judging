# Front-running attack to lockCapital()

## Summary
When ``lockCapital()`` gets executed, the ``exchangeRate`` - underlying tokens/share, will dramatically decreased. A user, however, can front-run ``lockCapital()`` to withdraw the underling tokens with the higher rate before the execution of ``lockCapital()``, and thus gaining advantage over their peers who have not done so. 

To be precise, one needs to front-run ``assessStates()`` due to the following call-chain: 
``assessStates() -> _assessState() -> _moveFromActiveToLockedState() -> _protectionPool.lockCapital()``, but we will say we front-run ``lockCapital()`` to make our discussion easier. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Below, we compare two users, Alice and Bob: Alice will front-run ``lockCapital()`` and withdraw her asset with the ``exchangeRate`` before the execution of  ``lockCapital()``, and Bob, on the other hand, will withdraw his shares after execution of ``lockCapital()``. The results of Alice and Bob are totally different. 

1) Suppose there are a total of 1,000,000 underlying tokens, and there are 1,000,000 shares. 
Suppose Alice and Bob each has 100,000 shares. The exchange rate now is 1/share. 

2) Suppose the ``DefaultStateManager`` will call the following the ``lockCapital()`` below to lock 500,000 underlying tokens, which will change the value of ``totalSTokenUnderlying`` (L418/L421).

3) Alice front-runs the ``lockCapital()`` with the function ``withdraw()`` (assuming a withdraw request has been made two cycles back) and withdraw  her 100,000 shares. She will get 100,000 underlying tokens since exchange rate is 1/1. After that, ``totalSTokenUnderlying = 900, 000``, ``totalSupply = 900,000``, exchange rate remains 1/share. 

4) Now ``lockCapital()`` gets executed, we end up with ``totalSTokenUnderlying = 400, 000``, ``totalSupply = 900,000`` and exchange rate becomes 4/9.

5) Bob also calls ``withdraw()`` (assuming a withdraw request has been made two cycles back) and withdraws his 100,000 shares. Unfortunately, he will only get  100,000*4/9 = 44,444 underlying tokens. 

6) While both Alice and Bob had 100,000 shares, Alice got 100,000 underlying tokens, while Bob only got 44,444 underlying tokens, a difference of 55,556 tokens. 

## Impact
A user who front-runs the ``lockCapital()`` transaction to withdraw will get more underlying tokens than those who not, assuming that they have the same number of shares.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Disable withdraw or limit the total withdraw amount during the cycle when ``lockCapital()`` needs to be executed
- Provide a upper bound for the amount that one can lock during each cycle. That means, the payout needs to be paid in installments.
