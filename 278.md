# Withdrawal amounts are not updated when seller unlock capital

## Summary

When capital is unlocked the `withdawlRequest` amounts of sellers are not updated. The result is that sellers that unlock their capital have the ability to re-deposit capital while still using their old `withdrawlRequestAmount`. Seller are supposed to not be able to withdrawal their deposits at the end of cycle n+2 if they entered at cycle n but here they can deposit capital again and remove it before cycle n+2.

## Vulnerability Detail

When capital is unlocked sellers care able to claim it but their `withdrawlRequests` are not changed. In the worst case scenario where the amount locked = totalSTokenunderlying they are able to unlock and extract all of their tokens after 2 payment terms if the lenderpool did not default. 

Example:

Seller deposits and requests withdrawal on day 20 of cycle n. At day 31 a payment is not paid before the grace period has passed. On day 91 they can unlock their capital.  They have now claimed all of their capital they still have a viable withdrawal request for day 180. They can now enter on any date and exit on day 180 e.g. breaking fundamental assumptions made.

## Impact

Sellers can under some circumstances remove a deposits when they should not be possible to do so. Protection buyers are under the assumption that deposits can not be removed until the end of the next cycle. The insolvency risk is based on this fact. This breaks this assumption and as a result protection buyers end up making decisions on false information and could end up insolvent in scenarios where they don't expect to be.

## Code Snippet

The withdrawal amount is not adjusted when unlocking.

## Recommendation

`WithdrawlRequested` in the withdrawlCycleDetails should be adjusted when capital is unlocked.
