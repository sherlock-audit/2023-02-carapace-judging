# Exploiting DefaultStateManager: How Anyone Can Cause Capital Loss for Protection Sellers

## Summary

Anyone can call the `calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital` function in the`DefaultStateManager` contract and cause capital loss for protection sellers. 

## Vulnerability Detail

 The `calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital`  function calculates and returns the total claimable amount from all locked capital instances. This function is meant to be called only by the `ProtectionPool` contract, but this is not enforced. As a result, anyone can call this external function and mark the unlocked capital as claimed for specific protection sellers.
 
## Impact

This is a high impact issue and can cause full or partial capital loss for protection sellers.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital(address _seller)
    external
    override
    returns (uint256 _claimedUnlockedCapital)

```

As you can see above, anyone can call this external function. Also, in the body of the function, there is no enforcement that only the `ProtectionPool` contract can call this function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check in the `calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital` function in the `DefaultStateManager` contract to enforce that only the relevant `ProtectionPool` contract can call this funcion.
