# Deposits can be DoS'ed during the pool cycle in Open state by sandwich attacks

## Summary
Deposits can be DoS'ed during the pool cycle in Open state by sandwich attacks
## Vulnerability Detail
From the docs; *All protection pools operate on a cycle basis. Each pool cycle has a fixed duration and open period (number of days at the beginning of the cycle) during which buyers can actually withdraw their liquidity from the protection pool based on their withdrawal requests. Once a seller requests a withdrawal, s/he can withdraw only after the end of the next pool cycle and during the open duration of the pool cycle.*

So when a user deposits liquidity via `ProtectionPool::deposit()`, below steps are executed;
1. The modifier checks whether the contract is paused and internally calls `_deposit`
2. `_deposit` deposits the specified amount of underlying token to the pool and mints the corresponding sToken shares to the receiver. The function first checks whether the current phase of the pool is not `OpenToBuyers`
3. If passed, on [line #1037](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1037), it mints _sTokenShares returned from the `convertToSToken` function. Minted shares are added globally to `totalSTokenUnderlying`.
4. On [Line #1045](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1045), it calculates the minimum required capital for the pool to be able to enable protection purchases.
5. If the minimum capital value is passed, it calculates the leverage ratio for the pool on [Line #1047](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1047)
6. If the calculated leverage ratio does not pass the Ceiling Leverage ratio of the pool, the `deposit()` function successes and events are emitted accordingly.

However, the deposits can be DoS'ed during Step 6.

Calculating Leverage Ratios is below;
1. `_deposit` internally calls `calculateLeverageRatio()`
2. `calculateLeverageRatio()` internally calls `_calculateLeverageRatio` by passing `totalSTokenUnderlying`
3. `_calculateLeverageRatio` returns the leverage ratio scaled to 18 decimals.
```solidity
  function _calculateLeverageRatio(uint256 _totalCapital)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256)
  {
    if (totalProtection == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    return (_totalCapital * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / totalProtection;
  }
```

So after some protections are bought -meaning the total underlying amount of protection bought from the pool by protection buyers is not zero-, an actor/bot can monitor the mempool for `deposit()` funcsig and sandwich the depositors by a flash loan.
1. A user click `deposit()` in order to mint X number of shares
2. The attacker takes a very large flash loan and frontruns the user by depositing the loans with `deposit()` and then backruns with `withdraw()`. The aim is to mint Y number of shares which is sufficient to touch the `leverageRatioCeiling` 
3. The attacker's shares get minted and the `totalSTokenUnderlying` gets enormously inflated sufficiently to touch the `leverageRatioCeiling`
4. The user's deposit reverts with the error `ProtectionPoolLeverageRatioTooHigh(_leverageRatio)`
5. The attacker withdraws the funds since the pool cycle is in Open status. And it can continue to attack the next depositors as well.


## Impact
Denial of the system

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   * @dev Calculate the leverage ratio for the pool.
   * @param _totalCapital the total capital of the pool in underlying token
   * @return the leverage ratio scaled to 18 decimals
   */
  function _calculateLeverageRatio(uint256 _totalCapital)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256)
  {
    if (totalProtection == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    return (_totalCapital * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / totalProtection;
  } 
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A withdrawal cooldown period at least as `block.number + 1` after the `deposit()` transaction.
