# User can buy protection for 0 amount for free in order to be able to renew it with not 0 amount when they think pool will default

## Summary
User can buy protection for 0 amount for free in order to be able to renew it with not 0 amount when they think pool will default 
## Vulnerability Detail
When users buys protection he provides amount that he wants to protect. There is no any limit. Amount should be [less than principal amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ReferenceLendingPools.sol#L161-L167) inside lending pool.

User are limited to buy protection in 90 days after lending pool is lauched in protection pool. After that they can only renew this protection. The amount that they can provide in renewing should also be not bigger than principal amount inside lending pool. There is no any check that amount should be same as in previous protection.

The premium that user pays for protection depends on amount they want to protect. In case if amount is 0, then [premium will be 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/PremiumCalculator.sol#L118-L120) as well.

This allows user to buy protection for 0 amount and then have ability to renew it also for free. When they are certain that pool will default, they can then renew protection with their principal amount in lending pool and pay premium in order to revceive repayment later.

Such approach allows user to not pay premium for ability to use pool and then renew protection to recieve payment. 
## Impact
User uses pool without paying for protection.

## Recommendation
I think that renewing should not allow to increase protection amount.
