# Seller can both claim and withdraw when pool changes from locked to active

## Summary

Seller can both claim and withdraw when pool changes from locked to active

## Vulnerability Detail

When a pool changes from Active to Late, a snapshot of seller `sToken` balances will be taken to determine their share of the locked capital through `_moveFromActiveToLockedState`

```solidity
  function _moveFromActiveToLockedState(
    ProtectionPoolState storage poolState,
    address _lendingPool
  ) internal {
    IProtectionPool _protectionPool = poolState.protectionPool;

    /// step 1: calculate & lock the capital amount in the protection pool
    (uint256 _lockedCapital, uint256 _snapshotId) = _protectionPool.lockCapital(
      _lendingPool
    );

    /// step 2: create and store an instance of locked capital for the lending pool
    poolState.lockedCapitals[_lendingPool].push(
      LockedCapital({
        snapshotId: _snapshotId,
        amount: _lockedCapital,
        locked: true
      })
    );
```

If the pool changes from Late to Active, `_moveFromLockedToActiveState` is called and sellers can claim the underlying token:

```solidity
function claimUnlockedCapital(address _receiver)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
  {
    /// Investors can claim their total share of released/unlocked capital across all lending pools
    uint256 _claimableAmount = defaultStateManager
      .calculateAndClaimUnlockedCapital(msg.sender);

    if (_claimableAmount > 0) {
      console.log(
        "Total sToken underlying: %s, claimableAmount: %s",
        totalSTokenUnderlying,
        _claimableAmount
      );
      /// transfer the share of unlocked capital to the receiver
      poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, _claimableAmount);
    }
  }
```

The issue is that claiming will not burn their `sToken` and therefore sellers who had made a withdrawal request in the n-2 cycle can make a successful withdrawal. This despite them having already claimed.

Although a withdrawal needs the pool to be in the open state, the daily cron that runs the  `ProtectionPoolCycleManager::calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` will set the pool open just by checking if a cycleDuration has passed since the pool was locked.

```solidity
 /// If cycle is locked, then check if it's time to start a new cycle.
    else if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Locked) {
      /// If current time is past the total cycle duration, then start a new cycle.
      if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.cycleDuration
      ) {
        /// move current cycle to a new cycle
        _startNewCycle(
          _protectionPoolAddress,
          poolCycle,
          poolCycle.currentCycleIndex + 1
        );
        _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState.Open;
      }
```


## Impact

Malicious sellers will get twice the amount owed to them if they claim and withdraw.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution may be to reset all withdrawal requests when a pool enters the locked state. There would also need to be other mitigations related to the handling of cycle state and sTokens. Having two separate ways of sellers accessing their underlying should be considered further and if possible make it a one unified process.
