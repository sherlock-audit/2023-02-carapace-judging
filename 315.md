# `DefaultStateManager.assessStates()` can be DOS if there is enough protection pools

## Summary
If too many protection pools are created, `DefaultStateManager.assessStates()` will revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a protection pool is created, it is pushed to `protectionPoolStates`.
`assessStates()` which is a function called daily by the protocol, loops through the entire `protectionPoolStates` array. If it is large enough, the call will revert with an out-of-gas error.

## Impact
`assessStates` reverting means it is impossible to update the states of the pools, preventing unlocking pools that need to be (or vice-versa)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in `registerProtectionPool()` to ensure `protectionPoolStates` never exceeds a pre-defined upper limit.
