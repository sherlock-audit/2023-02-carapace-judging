# # [H-01] Protection buyers could not claim the locked funds in case of defaulted lending pool.

## Summary

The implementation for transiting to default state and how protection buyers could claim the protection amount is missing.

## Vulnerability Details

When the lending pool state is default, the locked underlying assets cannot be claimed by protection buyers. It is due to missing implementation in the current version. 
- There is no function for claim in lending pool contract. 
- The state management does not implement functions to unlock assets for protection buyers.

## Impact

Protection buyers lose the covered amount because they cannot claim.
