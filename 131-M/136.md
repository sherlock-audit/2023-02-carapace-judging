# Protection seller withdraw may burn sToken shares in return for 0 underlying tokens after a lockCapital

## Summary

`ProtectionPool.convertToUnderlying` will return 0 in case a `ProtectionPool.lockCapital` is triggered and zeroes out the `totalSTokenUnderlying` value. As a result, a `withdraw` will then burn all user's `sToken` shares and give them nothing in return.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the DefaultStateManager [locks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L357) the protection pool capital, in case of a [late payment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L332) in the lending pool, it will reduce the amount of [`totalSTokenUnderlying`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L421) in order to prepare for a default payout. 

As a result, `_getExchangeRate` [returns 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L913-L931) if the whole `totalSTokenUnderlying` was locked. 

At this time, it will not be possible to perform a `withdraw`, since the pool [will NOT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L229) be in open state. 

However, if the pool [goes back](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L351) to active state, protection sellers calling `withdraw` (after having requested withdraw 2 cycles earlier) will exchange their `sToken` for 0 underlying tokens.

## Impact

Protection sellers requesting withdraw may receive 0 underlying tokens after an event of a late payment of the lending pool.

Because this issue has some preconditions, the suggested severity is Medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update `DefaultStateManager._moveFromLockedToActiveState` to reset back the `totalSTokenUnderlying` after a late payment is made.
