# Missing check to verify if _underlyingAmountToDeposit is !=0

## Summary
Missing check to verify if _underlyingAmountToDeposit is !=0

## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract `PoolProtection.sol`, there is a missing check in the `depositAndRequestWithdrawal` function to check that _underlyingAmountToDeposit is !=0. 

## Impact
In the `depositAndRequestWithdrawal` function - if _underlyingAmountToDeposit is = 0, the deposit step is skipped and only the withdrawal request will be made. This may not be aligned with user's intention to use this function to simultaneously deposit and withdraw i.e. undesirable if it is the user's intention to also make a deposit to the pool. This may frustrate users and potentially result in reputational risks to the protocol.
