# "GoldfinchAdapter" Contract there's Missing Error Handling

## Summary
`GoldfinchAdapter` contract, which acts as an adapter for the Goldfinch lending protocol, is a missing error handling vulnerability in its public and external functions, specifically the `getLendingPoolTermEndTimestamp` function. It assumes that the input parameter is a valid contract address and will revert if it is not, this will allow attackers to manipulate or exploit the contract and cause financial losses or instability of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `getLendingPoolTermEndTimestamp` function, it assumes that the `_lendingPoolAddress` parameter is a valid contract address and does not have any input validation or error handling for invalid inputs.
```solidity
ICreditLine _creditLine = _getCreditLine(_lendingPoolAddress);
```
Ihe `getLendingPoolTermEndTimestamp` function assumes that the `_lendingPoolAddress` parameter is a valid contract address and will revert if it is not. But the function does not validate the input and therefore does not provide appropriate error handling if invalid input is passed, and as a result of that, the function may throw an exception that can cause unexpected behavior or even disruption to the application.

## Impact
Since there is no input validation or error handling in place, attackers may be able to input invalid parameters, leading to an exploited contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement input validation and error handling in all public and external functions by adding a "require" statement at the beginning of each function to ensure that the inputs are valid and contract states are correct before proceeding with the rest of the function.

For example, in the `getLendingPoolTermEndTimestamp` function, a `require` statement can be added to check whether the `_lendingPoolAddress` parameter is a valid contract address, by using the `isContract` function provided. If the `_lendingPoolAddress` parameter is not a valid contract address, the function should revert with an appropriate error message.
