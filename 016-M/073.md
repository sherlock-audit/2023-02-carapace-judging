# ProtectionPool.withdraw should accrue premium before user withdraws

## Summary
ProtectionPool.withdraw should accrue premium before user withdraws
## Vulnerability Detail
When user calls `withdraw`, then his requested amount [is converted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L253-L255) to underlying amount.

`accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` function collects all premium from protections and [updates totalSTokenUnderlying  variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L346). After this call user can withdraw more underlying amount for same sToken amount(in case if premium was accrued).

When user withdraws, then `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` is not called and as result totalSTokenUnderlying is not increased and withdrawer receives less underlying tokens then he should.
## Impact
User loses premium payment.
