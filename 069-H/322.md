# Accrued Premium is calculated incorrectly

## Summary
Calculation is done erroneously for AP therefore 
`total_sToken_underlying` will be greater than it should be. 
## Vulnerability Detail
As per the protocol documentation, the Accrued Premium is derived from k * lamda with the premium (excluding protocol fees) but the premium is never reduced by the fees ,thereby

The premium amount which is [scaled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L128) is without fee and this is used to calculate [k](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/AccruedPremiumCalculator.sol#L85)

when the premiums are accrued, this erroneous value will translate to a higher premium :

## Impact
Shares of sToken will be inflated since exchange rate will be higher as a result of a higher accrued premium

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After the lamda and k is calculated in `_verifyAndCreateProtection` deduct the protocol fee which is calculated here :
