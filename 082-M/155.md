# ProtectionPoolCycle state is not checked when a buyer is buying protection

## Summary

ProtectionPoolCycle state is not checked when a buyer is buying protection.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is the function flow for buying a premium:

`ProtectionPool#buyProtection()` -> `ProtectionPool#_verifyAndCreateProtection()` -> `ProtectionPoolHelper#verifyProtection()` -> `ProtectionPoolHelper#_verifyProtectionDuration()` -> `ProtectionPoolCycleManager#calculateAndSetPoolCycleState()` ->  ... 

The issue of interest lies in the function `_verifyProtectionDuration()` and the following call to `calculateandSetPoolCycleState()`. In `_verifyProtectionDuration()`, the function wants to verify that the protection duration is valid, otherwise it reverts. The protection duration has to be above the minimum protection duration.

```solidity
  function _verifyProtectionDuration(
    IProtectionPoolCycleManager poolCycleManager,
    address _poolAddress,
    uint256 _protectionStartTimestamp,
    uint256 _protectionDurationInSeconds,
    uint256 _minProtectionDurationInSeconds
  ) internal {
    uint256 _protectionExpirationTimestamp = _protectionStartTimestamp +
      _protectionDurationInSeconds;
    /// protection duration must be longer than specified minimum
    if (_protectionDurationInSeconds < _minProtectionDurationInSeconds) {
      revert IProtectionPool.ProtectionDurationTooShort(
        _protectionDurationInSeconds
      );
    }


    /// protection expiry can not be be after the next cycle end
    poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState(_poolAddress);
    uint256 _nextCycleEndTimestamp = poolCycleManager.getNextCycleEndTimestamp(
      _poolAddress
    );


    if (_protectionExpirationTimestamp > _nextCycleEndTimestamp) {
      revert IProtectionPool.ProtectionDurationTooLong(
        _protectionDurationInSeconds
      );
    }
  }
}
```

The function then calls `ProtectionPoolCycleManager#calculateAndSetPoolCycleState()`

```solidity
    /// protection expiry can not be be after the next cycle end
    poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState(_poolAddress);
```

which is supposed to return a value _newState

```solidity
  function calculateAndSetPoolCycleState(address _protectionPoolAddress)
    external
    override
    returns (ProtectionPoolCycleState _newState)
```

Otherwise, the function changes the current state and returns the _newState.

```solidity
    ProtectionPoolCycleState currentState = _newState = poolCycle
      .currentCycleState;


    /// If cycle is not started, that means pool is NOT registered yet.
    /// So, we can't move the cycle state
    if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.None) {
      return _newState;
    }


    /// If cycle is open, then check if it's time to move to LOCKED state.
    if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Open) {
      /// If current time is past the initial open duration, then move to LOCKED state.
      if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.openCycleDuration
      ) {
        poolCycle.currentCycleState = _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState
          .Locked;
      }
    }
    /// If cycle is locked, then check if it's time to start a new cycle.
    else if (currentState == ProtectionPoolCycleState.Locked) {
      /// If current time is past the total cycle duration, then start a new cycle.
      if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.cycleDuration
      ) {
        /// move current cycle to a new cycle
        _startNewCycle(
          _protectionPoolAddress,
          poolCycle,
          poolCycle.currentCycleIndex + 1
        );
        _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState.Open;
      }
    }


    return _newState;
```

However, the return value is not captured and the state is not checked at all in  `_verifyProtectionDuration`. If the state is currently at none, the function should revert because the pool is still unregistered, as mentioned in the documentation.

```solidity
    /// protection expiry can not be be after the next cycle end
    poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState(_poolAddress);
```


## Impact

Buyers can buy protection at a None state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend to check the return value of `calculateAndSetPoolCycleState()`, something like this anywhere in `_verifyProtectionDuration()`.

```solidity
    /// protection expiry can not be be after the next cycle end
    require(poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleState(_poolAddress) != ProtectionPoolCycleState.None, "Wrong State");
```
