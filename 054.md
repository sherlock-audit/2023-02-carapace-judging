# Possibility of deposits reverting in rare scenario where pool goes from locked to active state

## Summary
There's the possibility that deposits revert if a pool goes from the locked to the active state.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a pool defaults, the ProtectionPool contract locks up the capital provided to cover the protection buyers. It's possible that *all* of the underlying tokens are locked up. In that case, the `totalSTokenUnderlying` state variable is set to `0`. That variable is used to keep track of all the deposits made by protection sellers. If the protection pool is moved to the active state after two periods passed, subsequent deposits will fail because of an underflow in the `convertToSToken()` function because `totalSTokenUnderlying` is `0`.

## Impact
Sellers won't be able to deposit funds into the protection pool which puts it out of service.

## Code Snippet
In `lockCapital()` there's the possibility of `totalSTokenUnderlying` being set to `0`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L357-L424
```sol
    unchecked {
      /// step 3: Update total locked & available capital in storage
      if (totalSTokenUnderlying < _lockedAmount) {
        /// If totalSTokenUnderlying < _lockedAmount, then lock all available capital
        _lockedAmount = totalSTokenUnderlying;
        totalSTokenUnderlying = 0;
      } else {
        /// Reduce the total sToken underlying amount by the locked amount
        totalSTokenUnderlying -= _lockedAmount;
      }
    }
```

When the pool is later on set to active using [`DefaultStateManager._moveFromLockedToActiveState()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L425) subsequent deposits will fail because of the call to `convertToSToken()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L588-L606

```sol
    function convertToSToken(uint256 _underlyingAmount)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 _scaledUnderlyingAmt = ProtectionPoolHelper
            .scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
                _underlyingAmount,
                poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
            );

        /// if there are no sTokens in the pool, return the underlying amount
        if (totalSupply() == 0) return _scaledUnderlyingAmt;

        // @audit _getExchangeRate() can return 0 if `totalSTokenUnderlying` is zero
        // In the initial state of the contract, `totalSupply()` would also be 0 which would trigger the if clause above.
        // But, if capital was locked, the `totalSTokenUnderlying` value *could* be set to 0 while totalSupply != 0.
        // In that case, calls to this function would revert because of the division by 0
        return
            (_scaledUnderlyingAmt * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) /
            _getExchangeRate();
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change [line 602](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L602) to:
```sol
    if (totalSupply() == 0 || totalSTokenUnderlying == 0) return _scaledUnderlyingAmt;
```
