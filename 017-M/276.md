# Buyers can withdraw their liquidity after open period ends

## Summary

Buyers can withdraw their liquidity after open period ends until someone calls `calculateAndSetPoolCycleState`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` needs to be explicitly called to change the state of `ProtectionPoolCycleState` from Open to Locked. But till then even if the open period is over, buyers can still withdraw their liquidity from the protection pool.

## Impact

Buyers can withdraw their liquidity after open period ends

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: ProtectionPoolCycleManager.sol

    if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.openCycleDuration
      ) {
        poolCycle.currentCycleState = _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState
          .Locked;
      }

```
