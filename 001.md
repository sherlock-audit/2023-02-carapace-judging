# Efficiency issue: Unnecessary storage access.

## Summary

Duplicate access to storage variable in the assessState() function of ReferenceLendingPools.causes increased gas usage. Recommend updating the code to use memory variable instead of storage variable to reduce costs.


## Vulnerability Detail

The assessState() function of ReferenceLendingPools is used to iterate through all the lending pools and retrieve their statuses. In the loop, a memory variable is used to copy the value of the storage variable, but it is not used in the subsequent call instead same storage variable is called again. This may be an oversight from the developer and should be addressed.

## Recommendation

Update the code as below:

```solidity
  for (uint256 i; i < _length; ) {
      _lendingPools[i] = lendingPools[i];
      //  use memory array _lendingPool[i] instead of lendingPools[i] which is a storage variable. This will reduce gas costs.
      _statuses[i] = _getLendingPoolStatus(_lendingPools[i]);

```
