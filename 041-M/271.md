# Buyers of protection can be protected in the first 90 days without paying a premium

## Summary
In the first 90 days of lending pool protection can be bought at any time. A protection buyer can be protected for the first 90 days without buying protection by monitoring if payments are done and only buy protection if a payment is missed. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Example: A protection buyer wishes to be protected for 180 days. Instead of buying 180 days they do the following:
 (Assume 30 day payment frequency, 10 day extension period, lender pool added day 0)

1. Monitor if payments are made in time.
2. If they are made in time they don't buy a protection for the first 90 days. 
3. If a payment is not made the buyer front-runs the `assessState()` function that would have made turned the state from Active -> LateWithGracePeriod. By doing so they buy a protection just before the lender pool is locked.

They will achieved protection for 180 days but only paid a premium for max 160 (if the first payment is late) and min only 90 days if no payments are missed for the first 90 days.

    
## Impact

Protection buyers can abuse this vulnerability to pay less premium than they should. They can receive up to 90 days free protection. They are in a sense stealing from seller since they are  in practice protected for a period that they are not paying for.

## Code Snippet
`_verifyProtectionDuration()` can be called arbitrarily close to the next payment deadline.

## Tool used

Manual Review, vscode, foundry

## Recommendation
A renewal can never be made x hours before a payment is due. This way protection buyers have to be exposed to the actual risk and either pay for the full period or chose to not renew the protection.
