# `_calculateLeverageRatio()` is computed wrongly

## Summary
`_calculateLeverageRatio()` is used to determine if protection can be purchased. Protocol should maintain a certain percentage of leverage ratio given the protectionAmount purchased. It is important that this is computed correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_calculateLeverageRatio()` is calculated as seen below. This is incorrect. A higher leverage ratio should indicate that the protocol is in debt. It is not a positive occurance. However, we can see that in the below computation, having a higher `_totalCapital` increases leverage ratio, but this should not be the case since we have more assets. A higher protection (can be considered debt here), should increase leverage ratio instead.

```solidity
  function _calculateLeverageRatio(uint256 _totalCapital)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256)
  {
    if (totalProtection == 0) {
      return 0;
    }

    return (_totalCapital * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / totalProtection;
  }
```

## Impact
Wrong computation of leverage ratio, a key component in determining the financial prowess of the protocol.

## Recommendation
Consider making the changes as such.

```diff
function _calculateLeverageRatio(uint256 _totalCapital)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256)
    {
-    if (totalProtection == 0) {
+    if (_totalCapital == 0){
-        return 0;
+        return type(uint256).max;
    }

-    return (_totalCapital * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / totalProtection;
+    return (totalProtection * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _totalCapital;
}
```
