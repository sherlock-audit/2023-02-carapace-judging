# Protection buyer loses protection if NFT is transferred or split

## Summary
A lender on an external lending platform such as Goldfinch gets an NFT to represent their loan. This NFT is checked for ownership when buying a protection on Carapace. However if later the NFT is transferred or split, the protection is invalidated.

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see in the function `calculateRemainingPrincipal`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/adapters/GoldfinchAdapter.sol#L153-L179

That ownership is rechecked, and if the protection buyer is not the holder anymore, remainingCapital is considered to be zero.

When capital is about to be locked this function is called again to cap the amount to be locked, using the original protection buyer:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L389-L395

So if the protection.buyer is not the holder anymore 0 capital is locked for this protection.

## Impact
The protection buyer loses the protection they paid for, which should not be the case.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Once the protection has been bought, do not recheck NFT ownership. Maybe consider issuing an NFT for the protection, meaning that the protection buyer had ownership of the loan NFT at the moment of buying the protection.
