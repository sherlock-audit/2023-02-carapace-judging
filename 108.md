# Malicious user can cause a DOS attack on critical pool functions such as `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` and `lockCapital`

## Summary
A malicious user can buy very small amount of protection against a given loan position. This can create a practically unlimited number of active protections.

Mission critical operations such as `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` that are run via a `cron job` can be DOSed as the function loops over all active Protections for each lending pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Note that for every protection, a new item is pushed to `protectionInfos` array. A malicious user can create an unbounded array by buying a small amount of protection each time.

```solidity

  function _verifyAndCreateProtection(
    uint256 _protectionStartTimestamp,
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount,
    bool _isRenewal
  ) internal {
    ...
    /// Step 5: Add protection to the pool
    protectionInfos.push(
      ProtectionInfo({
        buyer: msg.sender,
        protectionPremium: _premiumAmount,
        startTimestamp: _protectionStartTimestamp,
        K: _k,
        lambda: _lambda,
        expired: false,
        purchaseParams: _protectionPurchaseParams
      })
    );
    ...
}
```

`_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` that is responsible to accrue premium to sellers and retire expired positions can run into large loops and revert with `out of gas` exception.

```solidity
  function _accruePremiumAndExpireProtections(
    LendingPoolDetail storage lendingPoolDetail,
    uint256 _lastPremiumAccrualTimestamp,
    uint256 _latestPaymentTimestamp
  )
    internal
    returns (
      uint256 _accruedPremiumForLendingPool,
      uint256 _totalProtectionRemoved
    )
  {
    ...
  uint256 _length = _protectionIndexes.length;
    for (uint256 j; j < _length; ) {
      uint256 _protectionIndex = _protectionIndexes[j];
      ProtectionInfo storage protectionInfo = protectionInfos[_protectionIndex];
        ...
          unchecked {
        ++j;
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

A similar case exists for `lockCapital` that loops over all active protection indexes.

## Impact
If `_accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` is DOS'ed, protection sellers will not earn yield on deposits leading to a dysfunctional pool. Similar impact for `lockCapital`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend having a `miniumProtectionPercent` variable as part of protection pool parameters. This should be a percentage of outstanding principal of a buyer. If set at say 10%, a 1000 USDC lender has to take a minimum protection of 100 USDC in a single transaction while a 1 million USDC lender has to take a minimum protection of 100k USDC

Alternate method (and less preferable) is to cap the number of protection buy transactions per user
