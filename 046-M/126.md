# No way to exercise the protection if the lending pool goes to default state / protection seller can never get their capital unlocked

## Summary

No way to exercise the protection if the lending pool goes to default state / protection seller can never get their capital unlocked

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the doc:

https://www.carapace.finance/docs/protocol-mechanics/protection_sellers#default

> The primary risk that protection sellers face is the probability of default caused due to non-repayment in the underlying lending pools that are being protected. When default occurs, protection sellers lose capital which has been locked in the Carapace pool.

> In practice, when default occurs, protection buyers are provided with an option on whether to receive a payout or not. If they choose to exercise their protection and receive payout, these funds will be taken from the Carapace Pool and protection sellers will end up losing this amount. In exchange, protection sellers will receive underlying LP tokens associated with the default payout.

> Note that payouts cannot exceed principal loss suffered by a particular protection buyer i.e. excludes interest payments and principal repaid up to date of default

However, I do not think in the current implementation, there is a option for the buyer to exercise the protection to make the seller cover the lending pool default at all, basically, the buyer lose the premium paid to seller.

Also according to the documentation, if the buyer is not willing to offer the underlying LP token associated with the default payout. the state is hanging and the protection seller can never lock their capital, basically the protection buyer has to option to lock protection seller's fund infinitely.

## Impact

No way to exercise the protection if the lending pool goes to default state/protection seller can never get their capital unlocked

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend implementing the code to let buyers exercise insurance protection and make sure that after a certain amount of time period passes if the buyer does not exercise the protection, the seller can claim the fund back.
