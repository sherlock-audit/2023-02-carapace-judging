# Minimum protection duration for seconds is too short and can be abused

## Summary

The `_minProtectionDurationInSeconds` is too short and allows buyers to renew with a proper protection amount only when they know there is a default about to happen.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_minProtectionDurationInSeconds` is currently set to a day when someone renews their protection:

```js
_verifyProtectionDuration(
    poolCycleManager,
    _protectionPool,
    _protectionStartTimestamp,
    _protectionPurchaseParams.protectionDurationInSeconds,
    _isRenewal
    ? Constants.SECONDS_IN_DAY_UINT
    : poolInfo.params.minProtectionDurationInSeconds
);
```

This allows someone to continously renew their protection for a day with a very low protection amount (could even be 0). This way they can avoid uncertainty and check on a daily basis whether a default is about to happen or not. And just when they are certain that there will be a default they renew their protection for the full amount they need.

## Impact

Avoiding fees for buyers/ loss of yield for sellers

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Increase the `_minProtectionDurationInSeconds` for renewals. For reference, the minimum duration for buying a new protection is 10 to 14 days in the test suite.

Also the document `Carapace - Protocol Parameters` explicitly states that a scenario `where buyers purchase protection for only one day on which payment in an underlying loan is expected to happen and get full protection equivalent to one payment period by paying one dayâ€™s premium` is supposed to be avoided.
