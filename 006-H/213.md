# [M] - Any person can renew their protection by just calling the `buyProtection` again.

## Summary

The protocol allows renewing of protections using the function `renewProtection`. However, the same "renewing" can be done by just calling `buyProtection` again.
This will allow anyone to renew their protection even if the grace period has ended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The below code is taken from `ProtectionPool.sol`. As you can see `_verifyAndCreateProtection` is used in both the buy and renew functions.
The only difference between these two functions are that the `renewProtection` calls `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection`.

And since there are no checks in buyProtection to see if protection has already been bought, The user simply has to just call the `buyProtection` again to renew his protection.


```solidity
function buyProtection(
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount
  ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    /// Verify that user can buy protection and then create protection
    _verifyAndCreateProtection(
      block.timestamp,
      _protectionPurchaseParams,
      _maxPremiumAmount,
      false
    );
  }

  /// @inheritdoc IProtectionPool
  function renewProtection(
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount
  ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    /// Verify that user can renew protection
    ProtectionPoolHelper.verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection(
      protectionBuyerAccounts,
      protectionInfos,
      _protectionPurchaseParams,
      poolInfo.params.protectionRenewalGracePeriodInSeconds
    );

    /// Verify that user can buy protection and then create a new protection for renewal
    _verifyAndCreateProtection(
      block.timestamp,
      _protectionPurchaseParams,
      _maxPremiumAmount,
      true
    );
  }
```

Now, Let's confirm if this is possible with the below test

```JavaScript
it("...should Succeed when renewing the expired protection's after grace period is over", async () => {
          await moveForwardTimeByDays(15); // grace period is 14 days

          await protectionPool.connect(_protectionBuyer3).buyProtection(
              {
                lendingPoolAddress: _lendingPool2,
                nftLpTokenId: 579,
                protectionAmount: parseUSDC("101"),
                protectionDurationInSeconds: getDaysInSeconds(10)
              },
              parseUSDC("10000")
            )
        });
```

## Impact

An expired protection can be renewed even after the grace period is over.

Manual review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
Add a check in `buyProtection` to see if the person calling the function already has bought a protection for the same lending pool as well as the same NFT Id.
