# Buyer can transfer the Goinfinch Pool Position NFT multiple times to different address to buy the premium protection multiple times, result in double counting of the protection amount

## Summary

Buyers can transfer the Goinfinch Pool Position NFT multiple times to different times to buy the premium protection multiple times

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, when buyers want to buy premium, the code verifies that the buyer hold the lending pool LP position.

According to the documentation:

https://www.carapace.finance/docs/protocol-mechanics/protection_buyers#evidence-of-lending-position

> While purchasing protection, a user will need to hold LP (liquidity provider) tokens.

> A seller does not need to deposit the LP token in a Carapace pool at the time of purchase - this is only a requirement if a buyer makes a claim for default payout

```solidity
  function _verifyAndCreateProtection(
    uint256 _protectionStartTimestamp,
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount,
    bool _isRenewal
  ) internal {
    /// Verify that user can buy protection
    ProtectionPoolHelper.verifyProtection(
      poolCycleManager,
      defaultStateManager,
      address(this),
      poolInfo,
      _protectionStartTimestamp,
      _protectionPurchaseParams,
      _isRenewal
    );

    /// Step 1: Calculate & check the leverage ratio
    /// Ensure that leverage ratio floor is never breached
    totalProtection += _protectionPurchaseParams.protectionAmount;
    uint256 _leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();
    if (_leverageRatio < poolInfo.params.leverageRatioFloor) {
      revert ProtectionPoolLeverageRatioTooLow(_leverageRatio);
    }
```

which calls:

```solidity
   if (
      !poolInfo.referenceLendingPools.canBuyProtection(
        msg.sender,
        _protectionPurchaseParams,
        _isRenewal
      )
    ) {
      revert IProtectionPool.ProtectionPurchaseNotAllowed(
        _protectionPurchaseParams
      );
    }
```

which calls:

```solidity
    /// When buyer is not renewing the existing protection and
    /// the protection purchase is NOT within purchase limit duration after
    /// a lending pool added, the buyer cannot purchase protection.
    /// i.e. if the purchase limit is 90 days, the buyer cannot purchase protection
    /// after 90 days of lending pool added to the basket
    if (
      !_isRenewal &&
      block.timestamp > lendingPoolInfo.protectionPurchaseLimitTimestamp
    ) {
      return false;
    }

    /// Verify that protection amount is less than or equal to the remaining principal
    /// that buyer has lent to the underlying lending pool
    return
      _purchaseParams.protectionAmount <=
      calculateRemainingPrincipal(
        _purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress,
        _buyer,
        _purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
      );
  }
```

which calls

```solidity
  /// @inheritdoc IReferenceLendingPools
  function calculateRemainingPrincipal(
    address _lendingPool,
    address _lender,
    uint256 _nftLpTokenId
  )
    public
    view
    override
    whenLendingPoolSupported(_lendingPool)
    returns (uint256)
  {
    return
      _getLendingProtocolAdapter(_lendingPool).calculateRemainingPrincipal(
        _lendingPool,
        _lender,
        _nftLpTokenId
      );
  }
```

Buyer can just hold Goinfinch Pool Position NFT, purchase the protection with premium, then transfer the NFT position to second address, and purchase the protection with premium again.

in the issue is that, double counting happens in the totalProtection for the same NFT position,

```solidity
    /// Step 1: Calculate & check the leverage ratio
    /// Ensure that leverage ratio floor is never breached
    totalProtection += _protectionPurchaseParams.protectionAmount;
    uint256 _leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();
```

later when the lockCaptial is called, more captial supplied by protection sellers would be locked because of the double counting of the protection amount. 

## Impact

Double counting of the protection amount for the same NFT lending position leads to wrong accounting of leverage ratio and locked more funds provided by protection sellers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol let user transfer the NFT lending position to the contract or use a map to make sure the same NFT position id cannot be used to purchase the protection multiple times.
