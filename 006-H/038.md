# C7e7eff - Ineffective remaining principal limit for buyer

C7e7eff
Medium

## Summary
When a buyer buys protection there is a check to limit the amount of protection that can be bought based on the remaining principal. However the limit can be breached by simply buying multiple protections on the same `nftLpTokenId`. The Goldfinch pooltoken doesn't even have to be moved to a new address to be able to do this.

## Vulnerability Detail
When protection is bought the remaining principal is checked and that level is enforced. There is however no check on whether there already exists a protection for this specific GoldFinch pooltoken.
```solidity
function calculateRemainingPrincipal(
    address _lendingPoolAddress,
    address _lender,
    uint256 _nftLpTokenId
  ) public view override returns (uint256 _principalRemaining) {
    IPoolTokens _poolTokens = _getPoolTokens();
...
	  /// If the token is for the specified lending pool and is a junior tranche, then calculate the remaining principal
      /// otherwise, the remaining principal is zero
      /// Only junior tranche is allowed to have protection coverage
      if (
        _tokenInfo.pool == _lendingPoolAddress &&
        _isJuniorTrancheId(_tokenInfo.tranche)
      ) {
        _principalRemaining =
          _tokenInfo.principalAmount -
          _tokenInfo.principalRedeemed;
      }
    }
  }
```

## Impact
Depending on how the claim payout is handled (this hasn't been implemented yet) the impact is either a buyer that can claim multiple protections on the same GoldFinch pooltoken (which could be higher than the principle) qualifying it as a high severity or a buyer that can buy and own multiple protections but only claim one of them (Medium).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track the amount of protection active per specific GoldFinch pooltoken (`nftLpTokenId`).  
Depending on design choices this can either be done in `GoldFinchAdapter` or the `ReferenceLendingPools`.
