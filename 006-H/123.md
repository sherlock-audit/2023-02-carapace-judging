# A buyer can buy more protection than his outsanding principal on lending pool

## Summary
A user can keep buying protection multiple times for smaller amounts that cumulatively add up to more than his outstanding principal. Protocol doesn't track cumulative protection purchased by a buyer when buying new protection.

This can lead to loss of premium for naive/first-time protection buyers who might (wrongly) think that they get higher payout if they buy more protection. `Accidental buying` (users not realising/forgetting that they already purchased) also ends up in buyers paying additional premium for no additional benefit.

## Vulnerability Detail
When users buy protection `verifyProtection` gets called that checks 
 - protection duration < next cycle end
 - lending pool is active and lastly,
 -  protection amount requested < outstanding principal in lending pool. 
  
 `canBuyProtection` function in `ReferenceLendingPools` checks if protection amount in `purchaseParams.protectionAmount` is less than outstanding principal of buyer.

Below is a code snapshot..

```solidity

 function canBuyProtection(
    address _buyer,
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _purchaseParams,
    bool _isRenewal
  )
    external
    view
    override
    whenLendingPoolSupported(_purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress)
    returns (bool)
  {
    ...
        // -audit comparing protectionAmount sent in purchase params with remaining principal
         return
      _purchaseParams.protectionAmount <=
      calculateRemainingPrincipal(
        _purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress,
        _buyer,
        _purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
      );

    ...

}

```
Note above that the only the current protection sought by buyer is compared with the outstanding principal. Buyer might have already bought protection upto the principal previously. Since that amount is not tracked here, `canBuyProtection` returns true even when cumulative protection exceeds the maximum payout (outstanding principal).


## Impact

Maximum payout offered by protocol is equal to the outstanding principal of buyer in the underlying lending pool. Buying more protection is just a complete loss of premium to protection buyers with no benefit whatsoever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cumulative protection amount for each user needs to be tracked inside `protectionBuyerAccounts` that tracks positions specific to each buyer. Recommend having following mapping similar to `lendingPoolToPremium` in `ProtectionBuyerAccounts` struct

```solidity
mapping(address=> uint256)lendingPoolToProtection;

```

`lendingPoolToProtection` should track the total active protection for a given buyer against a specific lending pool address. Condition inside `canBuyProtection` should check if the cumulative protection (instead of current protection) exceeds remaining principal

```solidity

      return
      _purchaseParams.protectionAmount + lendingPoolPremium[_buyer] <=
      calculateRemainingPrincipal(
        _purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress,
        _buyer,
        _purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
      );

```
