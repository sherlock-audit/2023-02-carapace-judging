# Zero value `openCycleDuration` locks the user funds.

## Summary
Zero value `openCycleDuration` locks the user funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
`ProtectionPoolCycleManager` has the `registerProtectionPool` in order to register the given protection pool and start a new cycle for it in `Open` state. It can only be called by ContractFactory address.

It takes the `_poolAddress` and the `_cycleParams` as `ProtectionPoolCycleParams` and executes validations such as the pool should not be registered before and reverting if `openCycleDuration` is greater than `cycleDuration`
If these validations pass, it registers the pool and starts a new cycle via internally calling [`_startNewCycle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/ProtectionPoolCycleManager.sol#L90) which starts a new protection pool cycle using specified cycle index as per the [NATSPEC](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/ProtectionPoolCycleManager.sol#L190-L195)

However, during the creation of the pool, `openCycleDuration` is never been checked to be greater than zero. 
If this parameter is passed as zero, the pool will be successfully created and the Cycle state will be set to zero without any trouble.
But the front end will not be aware that the actual condition does not permit withdrawals from the pool. So the users unknowingly will see the state as `Open` and deposit their funds. If any of the users want to withdraw their funds as the pool is in Open status, the withdrawal will be reverted by `whenPoolIsOpen` modifier of the `ProtectionPool` contract during `withdraw()` call.

E.g.;
1. Alice wants to deposit her funds into the pool.
2. She wants to deposit 1 Eth but mistakenly she sends 11 Eth (fat finger)
3. She realizes this and the UI shows that the pool state is in Open position with a tooltip stating *withdraw from the pool is allowed.*
4. Alice clicks withdraw() with the amount parameters and the call gets in validation by several modifiers including `whenPoolIsOpen` 
5. `whenPoolIsOpen` checks the `cycleState` of the current contract via calling `poolCycleManager.calculateAndSetPoolCycleState`
6. `calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` determines & sets the current cycle state of the given pool. Accordingly, it verifies the state is Open on [Line #115](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/ProtectionPoolCycleManager.sol#L115)
7. Line #118-119 verifies that the Open cycle duration is already over and locks the pool.
```solidity
      /// If current time is past the initial open duration, then move to LOCKED state.
      if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.openCycleDuration
      ) {
        poolCycle.currentCycleState = _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState
          .Locked;
      }
```

8. Alice fails to withdraw her tokens and she requests withdrawal via `requestWithdrawal` to withdraw during upcoming cycles but it will be repeating the same steps since the Open duration is not actually set with a positive value.

## Impact
Locking of funds, loss of protocol reputation 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function registerProtectionPool(
    address _poolAddress,
    ProtectionPoolCycleParams calldata _cycleParams
  ) external payable override onlyContractFactory {
    ProtectionPoolCycle storage poolCycle = protectionPoolCycles[_poolAddress];


    if (poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime > 0) {
      revert ProtectionPoolAlreadyRegistered(_poolAddress);
    }


    /// Cycle duration must be greater than open cycle duration
    if (_cycleParams.openCycleDuration > _cycleParams.cycleDuration) {
      revert InvalidCycleDuration(_cycleParams.cycleDuration);
    }


    /// Store cycle params and start a new cycle for newly registered pool
    poolCycle.params = _cycleParams;
    _startNewCycle(_poolAddress, poolCycle, 0);
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate `openCycleDuration` is greater than zero. Also, it would be best if there is a minimum Open cycle limit duration implemented by the protocol. Narrow openCycleDurations also may harm the users.
