# First deposit can be exploited to break share calculation

## Summary
This is a common attack vector involving shares based liquidity pool contracts. An early user can manipulate the price per share and profit from late users' deposits because of the precision loss caused by the rather large value of price per share.

## Vulnerability Detail
Apparently, the first investor depositing underlying tokens to the pool can maliciously manipulate the sToken share price by depositing the lowest possible amount with 1 wei of liquidity.

This can artificially and excessively inflate the base share price, forcing all subsequent deposits to be dictated by this share price as a base. Additionally, due to rounding down by default associated with division truncation, if this malicious initial deposit were to front-run someone else depositing, this depositor would end up receiving 0 shares and losing his/her deposited underlying assets.

## Impact
The sToken share price can be maliciously inflated on the initial deposit, leading to the next depositor sandwiched and losing underlying assets due to precision issues. Additionally, all subsequent depositors would contribute to the attacker's superfluous gain when the attacker eventually makes a withdrawal. 

## Code Snippet
Here is a typical exploit scenario where:

An empty pool is using DAI as its underlying asset when Alice wants to deposit 1000 tokens.

1. Bob, the attacker, upon seeing this transaction in the mempool decides to front run (sandwich) it by depositing an initial liquidity of 1 wei of DAI (scaled to 18 decimal due to [`scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L596)) via [`deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L198-L205) to get 1 wei of shares in exchange.
2. The exchange rate is now 1 wei of share per asset.
3. Bob transfers 1000 tokens of DAI directly to the pool contract (ProtectionPool.sol) to artificially inflate the asset (underlying token) balance without minting any new shares.
4. The asset balance is now 1000 ether + 1 wei of DAI, i.e. the share price is now very high which is equivalent to 1 wei of shares for 1000000000000000000001 wei or 1000*1e18 + 1 asset.
5. Next, Alice's deposit of 1000 tokens of DAI is executed.
6. Alice receives 0 shares due to a precision issue, i.e. 1000*1e18 / (1000*1e18 + 1).
7. Alice's deposited funds are deemed lost, and the rate now is 1 wei of shares for 2000e18 + 1 asset because her 1000 DAI tokens gets [transferred](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1038-L1042) to the contract only after `convertToSToken()` and [`_safeMint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1037) are executed. 
8. Bob can now request to withdraw his 1 wei of shares albeit to be calculated via [`convertToUnderlying()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L609-L620) during the `Open` state of cycle 3.  But, he is going to get way more than all the tokens he deposited and transferred plus Aliceâ€™s tokens in the absence of default payouts.
9. For simplicity of illustration, suppose there would only be 2 additional depositors between now till Bob could withdraw his shares. The next investor deposits 10000 tokens of DAI and only gets 4 instead of 4.9999... wei of shares due to the same precision issue described in step 6. The rate now is 5 wei of shares for 12000e18 + 1 asset. 
10. Next, another investor deposits 100000 tokens of DAI and receives 8 instead of 8.333... wei of shares. The rate now is 13 wei of shares for 112000 + 1 asset.
11. Bob who has 1 wei of shares eventually could withdraw 1 * 112000 / 13 equivalent to 8615 tokens of DAI. 

This would make Bob super rich if hundreds and thousands of depositors were to participate in the pool in the elapsed cycles considering there is no capping on capital in the protocol. 

Note: As denoted in the code block of `convertToSToken()` below, sToken shares are determined via its return statement that can be simplified as: 

```solidity
totalSupply() == 0 ? _scaledUnderlyingAmt : (_scaledUnderlyingAmt * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _getExchangeRate();
```
In the event of a very high share price, due to `totalSTokenUnderlying` (the numerator of the [_exchangeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L913-L931)) very much larger than `totalSupply()` (the denominator of the [_exchangeRate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L913-L931)), shares will be returned 0 in Alice's case and easily/significantly truncated for the other two depositors as described in the scenario above.

```solidity
  function convertToSToken(uint256 _underlyingAmount)
    public
    view
    override
    returns (uint256)
  {
    uint256 _scaledUnderlyingAmt = ProtectionPoolHelper
      .scaleUnderlyingAmtTo18Decimals(
        _underlyingAmount,
        poolInfo.underlyingToken.decimals()
      );

    /// if there are no sTokens in the pool, return the underlying amount
    if (totalSupply() == 0) return _scaledUnderlyingAmt;

    return
      (_scaledUnderlyingAmt * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / _getExchangeRate();
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider sending the first 1000 shares to address 0, a mitigation approach adopted by the Uniswap V2 protocol when totalSupply == 0.

Additionally, the protocol could look into implementing slippage protection in `_deposit()` to further mitigate the situations.
