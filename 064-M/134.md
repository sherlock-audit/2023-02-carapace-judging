# DefaultStateManager can be stuck

## Summary
The DefaultStateManager can be unable to update the status of the protection pools by being stuck on the function `DefaultStateManager.assessStates`, and so resulting in DoS and potentially to permanent DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail
This can happen because the function `DefaultStateManager.assessStates`, which is called at least once in a day by a cronjob, calls on each protection pool the `_assessState` function, (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L289). Now if the current protection pool is in `Active` or `LateWithinGracePeriod` state, then `_moveFromActiveToLockedState` will be called, (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L390). And finally, if the current protection pool was paused by the owner, then if we call `ProtectionPool.lockCapital` it will revert, which happens inside `_moveFromActiveToLockedState` function at the following loc https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L397-L399. The DoS becomes permanent if the ProtectionPool's owner private key is lost or compromised, which even if it is a far remote risk, it could be somehow possible as shown above.

## Impact
DoS on DefaultStateManager and permanent DoS under certain circumstances.

## Recommendation
The function `ProtectionPool.lockCapital` should be callable by DefaultStateManager even if the contract was paused.
