# Protection buyer can front-run default in the first 90 days

## Summary
Protection buyer can purchase protection at any point during the first 90 days. In case of early default, he can front-run the transaction and buy protection to receive guaranteed payouts.

## Vulnerability Detail
By design, protection can only be purchased in the first 90 days after the pool is added. This is done to prevent users from buying protection right before a missed payment. However, this issue still exists during the first 90 days. There is no incentive for buyers to get protection earlier than the 90th day. The can avoid paying premium for 89 days and rely on front-running to get into the pool before default happens.

## Impact
Bad incentives for buyers to purchase protection during the initial phase. Can lead to low liquidity during the initial phase and bad user experience

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I don't see an obvious way. The initial phase of 90 days might be a bit too long and can be reduced. Can also consider giving a discount on premium for first buyers to incentivize early participation
