# Malicious protection buyer can manipulate pool leverage ratio to block genuine protection buyers

## Summary

Protocol docs state that `naked protection buying` is not allowed - scenario where a protection buyer does not hold underlying loan position & yet makes a protection claim. This is currently enforced by verifying if protection buyer holds the NFT token when making a claim for protection payout.

Unfortunately, similar verification does not exist at the time of buying protection. This opens an attack vector by a malicious protection buyer who can keep transferring same NFT token across multiple addresses & keep buying protection in a calibrated manner to manipulate leverage ratio of protection pool.

Such an attack, although expensive for the attacker, can block genuine protection buyers. Newly launched pools are especially vulnerable to such attacks (refer to POC)

## Vulnerability Detail

When users buys protection, [`_verifyAndCreationProtection`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L795) verifies and creates a new protection. Note that there is no check to verify if the same NFT token is already used by a user who has active protection.

However, a check does exist to verify if the leverage ratio, after adding protection, falls below the floor level. If it does, no new protection buyer can come in until further sellers capitalise the pool to increase leverage ratio beyond this floor.

```solidity
  function _verifyAndCreateProtection(
    uint256 _protectionStartTimestamp,
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount,
    bool _isRenewal
  ) internal {

    ....

        /// Step 1: Calculate & check the leverage ratio
    /// Ensure that leverage ratio floor is never breached
    totalProtection += _protectionPurchaseParams.protectionAmount;
    uint256 _leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();
    if (_leverageRatio < poolInfo.params.leverageRatioFloor) {
      revert ProtectionPoolLeverageRatioTooLow(_leverageRatio);
    }
    ....
}

```

A new pool that has capital just above minimum capital, ie a pool that has just been upgraded to `Open` can be easily attacked by a user. Since the pool has just above minimum capital, capital needed to execute this attack will also be minimal.

**POC**

- A new pool with minimum capital of 100k USDC is launched (say Leverage Ratio Floor = 10%)
- Protection sellers capitalise the pool to 100k USDC
- Pool is now open to buyers
- Alice holds a NFT for loan position (say, 10k USDC) in Goldfinch lending pool that is part of current protection pool
- Alice waits for pool to be `Open`, ie leverage ratio falls below ceiling
- Alice creates a exploit contract that transfers NFT to a new address & buys protection in a loop until leverage ratio falls below floor value
- Every time a new protection seller comes in with `X` capital, Alice can run above loop to buy `10X` protection (to keep leverage ratio under 10%)
- Bob, a genuine protection buyer, gets DOS'd as pool leverage falls below floor if his protection is added 



## Impact

New pool is effectively dysfunctional as demand is centralised. Leverage ratio can be manipulated by a single buyer to block new users from becoming protection buyers.

## Recommendation
A mapping of lendingPool -> nftTokenId -> buyer needs to be created and tracked in `ProtectionPool`. Combination of lendingPool & nftTokenID should have a unique buyer for active protections.

Every time a new buyer comes in, this mapping should be updated. Every time a protection expires, this mapping is reset to 0 address.
