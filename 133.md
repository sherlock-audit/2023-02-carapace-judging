# Protection purchases can be bricked

## Summary
Protection purchases can be bricked 
## Vulnerability Detail
During `buyProtection` process, there are many validations ongoing in order to change the protection parameter states accordingly.
Below steps show the steps in order to successfully buy a protection.

1. The user calls `ProtectionPool`'s `buyProtection`
2. `buyProtection` internally calls `_verifyAndCreateProtection` checking the contract is not paused and passing inlined parameters
3. `_verifyAndCreateProtection` verifies protection purchase and creates protection in `7` steps if it is valid. 

Below are the NATSPEC for the steps;
>Step 1: Calculate & check the leverage ratio
Step 2: Calculate the protection premium amount scaled to 18 decimals and scale it down to the underlying token decimals.
Step 3: Calculate protection in days and scale it to 18 decimals.
Step 4: Capture loan protection data for premium accrual calculation
Step 5: Add protection to the pool
Step 6: Track all loan protections for a lending pool to calculate the total locked amount for the lending pool when/if the pool is late for payment
Step 7: transfer premium amount from buyer to pool

Before Step 1, the function calls `ProtectionPoolHelper`'s `verifyProtection` in order to verify that the user can buy protection. If this call passes, it continues with Step 1 and calculates the leverage ratio

4. After Step 1, at Step 2, the function calls `ProtectionPoolHelper`'s `calculateAndTrackPremium` in order to calculate and track the premium amount for the protection purchase. `calculateAndTrackPremium` internally calls `calculateProtectionPremium` in order to calculate the protection premium by passing inlined parameters.
5. `calculateProtectionPremium` calls `premiumCalculator`'s `calculatePremium` to return the premium amount in underlying tokens
and specifies whether the returned premium is a minimum premium or not. So it returns 2 values: `_premiumAmount` and `_isMinPremium`
6. `premiumCalculator::calculatePremium` validates the parameters by calling `RiskFactorCalculator` contract's `canCalculateRiskFactor` and `calculateRiskFactor`. In `calCalculateRiskFactor`, it checks whether the total capital is not less than the minimum required capital
and the leverage ratio is between floor and ceiling. If this function passes `premiumCalculator::calculatePremium` calls `RiskFactorCalculator::calculateRiskFactor`
7. `calculateRiskFactor` calculates and returns the risk factor scaled to 18 decimals. The whole function is below;
```solidity
  function calculateRiskFactor(
    uint256 _currentLeverageRatio,
    uint256 _leverageRatioFloor,
    uint256 _leverageRatioCeiling,
    uint256 _leverageRatioBuffer,
    uint256 _curvature
  ) external view returns (int256 _riskFactor) {
    console.log(
      "Calculating risk factor... leverage ratio: %s, floor: %s, ceiling: %s",
      _currentLeverageRatio,
      _leverageRatioFloor,
      _leverageRatioCeiling
    );

    int256 _numerator = int256(
      (_leverageRatioCeiling + _leverageRatioBuffer) - _currentLeverageRatio
    );

    int256 _denominator = int256(_currentLeverageRatio) -
      int256(_leverageRatioFloor - _leverageRatioBuffer);

    _riskFactor = (int256(_curvature) * _numerator) / _denominator;
    console.logInt(_riskFactor);
  }
```

As can be seen through the snippet the `_denominator` is not checked being not equal to zero. This seems to be a QA issue. However, it can be abused to brick the `ProtectionPool` contract during `buyProtection` call.

`calculateRiskFactor` takes the parameters below NATSPEC;
>@param _currentLeverageRatio the current leverage ratio of the pool scaled to 18 decimals
@param _leverageRatioFloor the minimum leverage ratio allowed in the pool scaled to 18 decimals
@param _leverageRatioCeiling the maximum leverage ratio allowed in the pool scaled to 18 decimals
@param _leverageRatioBuffer the buffer used in risk factor calculation scaled to 18 decimals
@param _curvature the curvature used in risk premium calculation scaled to 18 decimals


For a protection pool, the parameters `_leverageRatioFloor`, `_leverageRatioCeiling`, `_leverageRatioBuffer`, `_curvature` are set at the time of protection pool creation by the `ContractFactory`'s `createProtectionPool` function called by the owner. And `_currentLeverageRatio` is the dynamic type in the function. Accordingly, one can calculate and arrange the `_currentLeverageRatio` to make the `_denominator` zero.

```solidity
int256 _denominator = int256(_currentLeverageRatio) - int256(_leverageRatioFloor - _leverageRatioBuffer);
```

If we roll back all the steps back, `_currentLeverageRatio` is calculated by `ProtectionPool`'s `_calculateLeverageRatio` as below;
```solidity
  function _calculateLeverageRatio(uint256 _totalCapital)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256)
  {
    if (totalProtection == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    return (_totalCapital * Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS) / totalProtection;
  }
```
`_totalCapital` is the `totalSTokenUnderlying` which represents the total underlying amount in the pool.

So accordingly the attacker can buy protection to adjust `_totalCapital` & `totalProtection` and brick the pool since the function will panic during division with `0`. This attack path is favorable for the attacker at the early stages of the protection purchases (being a first depositor as well) since the values will be closer to each other to adjust.

The parameters `_leverageRatioFloor`, `_leverageRatioCeiling`, `_leverageRatioBuffer`, `_curvature` are not constant and can be updated by the owner via `ProtectionPool::updateLeverageRatioParams`. This can be a gaming solution for instance. However, the attack path might remain the same. 

## Impact
Denial of the system

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function calculateRiskFactor(
    uint256 _currentLeverageRatio,
    uint256 _leverageRatioFloor,
    uint256 _leverageRatioCeiling,
    uint256 _leverageRatioBuffer,
    uint256 _curvature
  ) external view returns (int256 _riskFactor) {
    console.log(
      "Calculating risk factor... leverage ratio: %s, floor: %s, ceiling: %s",
      _currentLeverageRatio,
      _leverageRatioFloor,
      _leverageRatioCeiling
    );

    int256 _numerator = int256(
      (_leverageRatioCeiling + _leverageRatioBuffer) - _currentLeverageRatio
    );

    int256 _denominator = int256(_currentLeverageRatio) -
      int256(_leverageRatioFloor - _leverageRatioBuffer);

    _riskFactor = (int256(_curvature) * _numerator) / _denominator;
    console.logInt(_riskFactor);
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the requirement for `_denominator != 0`
At the time of the `createProtectionPool`, the owner should strictly validate  `(_leverageRatioFloor - _leverageRatioBuffer)` will not be equal to the pool's currentLeverageRatio when the minRequiredCapital is deposited.
Also, since the `updateLeverageRatioParams` doesn't perform any parameter sanitization or check the contract's pause state, it would be beneficial to implement checks for this function as well.
