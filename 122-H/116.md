# Sybil on withdrawal requests can allow leverage factor manipulation with flashloans

## Summary
To be able to withdraw, a user has to request a withdraw first. The only requirement to be able to request a withdraw is to have a balance of SToken upon requesting. By requesting withdraws with the same tokens but from different addresses, a malicious user can create the option to withdraw during one cycle more than what is deposited in the protocol. They cannot drain the protocol since they only have a limited amount of SToken to burn (required to call `withdraw()`), but they acquire the ability to deposit new funds and withdraw them in the same block, thus manipulating premium prices.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:
A malicious user wants to manipulate `leverageRatio` (to get a cheaper premium for example).

They deposit 10k USDC into the protocol, and get 10k STokens.
They request immediately a withdraw, and transfer STokens to another address and request a withdraw there, repeating the process 10 times.

This works since balance is checked on requesting withdrawal but not locked or committed:

2 cycles later (actually ~1 cycle if the timing is optimized), they have the ability to take a flashloan for 100k USDC, deposit through the 10 addresses used, enjoy the cheaper premium as a protection buyer due to `leverageFactor` being high and withdraw all in the same transaction. 

They can safely repay the flash loan.

## Impact
Protection buyers can use this to: 
- game premium prices, meaning that protection sellers get rugged.
- overprotect their lending positions (used in conjunction with HIGH-02, it can drain the whole protection pool if lending pool defaults).
- DOS the protocol by sending the leverage factor very high.

## Recommendation
Freeze STokens for a depositor once they requested a withdrawal.
