# An attacker can flasloan NFTs to buy protection for the underlying system without lending any underlying tokens

## Summary
An attacker can use flashloans to earn an NFT for the duration of one transaction and bypass the check for NFT owning by the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attacker can flashloan an NFT once when he is buying a protection, and should be able to borrow the same NFT when the pool goes from `Active` to `Late`. This way, he can earn the protection money without actually lending any.
