# User's balance can be reused to submit a withdrawal request that breaks the logic of deposit and withdrawal

## Summary

When user make a withdrawal request there is no change and record for user's balance in the process. User's balance can be reused to submit a withdrawal request that breaks the logic of deposit and withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }

    /// Get current cycle index for this pool
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );

    /// Actual withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle after next cycle
    /// For example: if request is made in at some time in cycle 1,
    /// then withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 3
    uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;

    WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
      _withdrawalCycleIndex
    ];

    /// Cache existing requested amount for the cycle for the sender
    uint256 _oldRequestAmount = withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender];
    withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender] = _sTokenAmount;

    unchecked {
      /// Update total requested withdrawal amount for the cycle considering existing requested amount
      if (_oldRequestAmount > _sTokenAmount) {
        withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested -= (_oldRequestAmount -
          _sTokenAmount);
      } else {
        withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested += (_sTokenAmount -
          _oldRequestAmount);
      }
    }

    emit WithdrawalRequested(msg.sender, _sTokenAmount, _withdrawalCycleIndex);
  }
```

 As the code above, the protocol first check the user's balance and the number of withdrawals.
Then get current cycle index for this pool and record this withdrawal request in ```withdrawalCycleDetails[
      _withdrawalCycleIndex
    ];``` .
 Next  Update total requested withdrawal amount.  
The withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle currentCycle+2.
We noticed that there is no change and record for user's balance in the process ```uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);```. 
So user can reused the balance to submit a withdraw request in currentCycle+1.
When withdrawing the asset for the second request, user only need to mint stoken shares in advance

1.Assume Alice submit a withdrawal request by calling function ```requestWithdrawal()```  in cycle1. Then then withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 3
2.She resued the balance to submit a  withdrawal request in cycle2.  The withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 4.
3.She withdraw asset in cycle 3
4. She mints stoken shares by calling function ```function deposit()```
5. She withdraw asset in cycle 4.

## Impact

User's balance can be reused to submit a withdrawal request that breaks the logic of deposit and withdrawal
