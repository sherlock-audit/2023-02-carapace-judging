# There is a profitable Arbitrage path for users that incentivizes a secondary market on top of the protection pool to bypass the 2 cycle withdrawal delay

## Summary
Users can request for much more capital that what they actually have by utilizing flashloans, to request more withdrawals that what they actually have. By submitting this withdrawals, they can sell their option of withdrawal to other users for profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows users to submit withdrawal request as long as it is less than their current balance to have the option to withdraw in the next two cycles. Users can abuse this functionality to bypass the 2 cycle delay in withdrawal:

(1) user takes a flashloan from another user in cycle X to submit a request for X+2 for amount A to withdraw
(2) user waits for 2 cycles so he has the option to withdraw this amount
(3) user finds a customer that wants to withdraw amount A now 
(4) user again takes a flashloan to increase balance to A
(5) withdraws amount A from the contract
(6) send the underlying amount from withdrawing A to the customer and takes back their amount of A + profit
(7) user keeps the profit and sends A back to the flashloan

## Impact
This is economically bad for the protocol, one might argue that selling the Stoken in a secondary market has the same effect. But it should be noted that in this method, the the amount is being extracted from the underlying pool, decreasing the supply. But when users trade assets in a secondary market, they just swap, and nothing is extracted from the underlying pool.

## Recommendation
Users should be able to request withdrawal with an small delay after their balance is changed, this can help decrease the risk of attacks like this.
