# ProtectionPool#withdraw does not check the cycle state

## Summary

ProtectionPool#withdraw does not check the cycle state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The documentation states that the protection pool cycle moves through the following states:

```solidity
None: The cycle state of unregistered pools
Open: The cycle is open for withdrawal
Locked: The cycle is locked for withdrawal
```
Reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RihHcf-jS45BorVufVm4aYdXdQ65CaOxtW6ljz8DCOs/edit#

If the pool cycle is at locked, then there should be no withdrawals. However, `_requestWithdrawal()` and `withdraw()` does not verify that the pool is open for withdrawal or not.

In `_requestWithdrawal()`, the function gets the `_currentCycleIndex` and `WithdrawalCycleDetail` but only uses withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests and withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested. The three cycle states: none, open, locked, is not checked at all.

```solidity
    /// Get current cycle index for this pool
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );


    /// Actual withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle after next cycle
    /// For example: if request is made in at some time in cycle 1,
    /// then withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 3
    uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;


    WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
      _withdrawalCycleIndex
    ];
```

Similarly, in `withdraw()`, cycle state is not checked.

```solidity
    /// Step 1: Retrieve withdrawal details for current pool cycle index
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );
    WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
      _currentCycleIndex
    ];
```

## Impact

Sellers can still withdraw during locked period because of the lack of cycle state check.

## Recommendation

Recommend checking the state of the pool after every withdrawal. Use ProtectionPoolCycleManager#getCurrentCycleState() to check the state of the cycle. getCurrentCycleState will get the state of the cycle: none, open or withdraw. Cross check the state during every withdrawal or deposit.

```solidity
  function getCurrentCycleState(address _poolAddress)
    external
    view
    override
    returns (ProtectionPoolCycleState)
  {
    return protectionPoolCycles[_poolAddress].currentCycleState;
  }
```
```solidity
enum ProtectionPoolCycleState {
  None, // The cycle state for unregistered pools.
  Open, // The cycle is open for deposit & withdraw
  Locked // The cycle is in progress & locked for deposit & withdraw
}
```
