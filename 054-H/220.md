# Repeated requests of withdrawal

## Summary

It is possible to repeatedly signal the withdrawal request and re-use the same share tokens across multiple accounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

To withdraw deposited tokens, a user has to first request the withdrawal and then finalize it in an open period of cycle 3:
```solidity
  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }

    /// Get current cycle index for this pool
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );

    /// Actual withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle after next cycle
    /// For example: if request is made in at some time in cycle 1,
    /// then withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 3
    uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;

    ...
```

Based on my understanding, the current withdrawal request process can be tricked. For instance, the steps could be as follows:
1) Let's say a user wants to deposit 10k tokens in total.
2) He first deposits 1k tokens with 1 account and instantly requests a withdrawal. Now he has to wait till cycle 3 opens.
3) He rotates the shares he holds to the other 9 accounts that have no deposits made yet, but they can still request withdrawals because the system thinks their `_sTokenBalance` meets the requirements.
4) 1-2 cycles later, these 9 accounts deposit 1k tokens each. Because of an early request, now these accounts can escape the wait time and withdraw in the same cycle (until the pool is open) or when the next cycle opens.

## Impact

So if my assumptions are right, I have identified at least 2 problems:
1) When making a withdrawal request, old requests are not deleted, thus it is possible to repeatedly request withdrawals after each cycle. In other words, the `_requestWithdrawal` can be repeated in every round, meaning if you signal the withdrawal in every round, you can then make the actual withdrawal in any round after waiting for only the initial lock of 2 cycles.
2) You can re-use the same share tokens to request the withdrawal in advance to maximize the withdrawal amount and minimize the time you have to wait when actually deciding to withdraw. A flash-loan borrowing market might be created to facilitate this.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When a `_requestWithdrawal` is made, it should delete old request amounts of cycles 1 (current) and 2, to prevent trailing repeated requests.

Combating re-use of the same share tokens between accounts when making withdrawal requests is not so trivial, could probably utilize the snapshot balances of `ERC20SnapshotUpgradeable`.
