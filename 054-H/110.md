# Seller can withdrawal in any cycle and can withdraw any amount with the help of flashloan after two cycles passes

## Summary

User can withdrawal in any cycle and can withdraw any amount with the help of flashloan

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the documentation, 

https://www.carapace.finance/docs/protocol-mechanics/protection_sellers#request-for-withdrawal

> A withdrawal request gives the seller the option but not the obligation to withdraw funds after the end of the next cycle during the open state. A request will be invalid after the open state regardless of whether the withdrawal was made or not. Otherwise, you can withdraw at the beginning of any cycle with no economic cost

The requirement is that the user needs to make a request to withdraw, such timelock make sure the protection seller cover the risk of default instead of earning risk-free premium paid by buyer.

The implementation details is below in the ProtectionPool.sol

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Requests the specified amount of sToken for withdrawal from the pool.
   * @param _sTokenAmount the amount of sToken shares to withdraw
   */
  function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }

    /// Get current cycle index for this pool
    uint256 _currentCycleIndex = poolCycleManager.getCurrentCycleIndex(
      address(this)
    );

    /// Actual withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle after next cycle
    /// For example: if request is made in at some time in cycle 1,
    /// then withdrawal is allowed in open period of cycle 3
    uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;
```

for example, if user make request in cycle 1, the user cannot withdraw until cycle 3.

However, such restriction can be easily bypassed starting cycle 2.

because the amount of token requested to withdraw is checked based on the current balance of the user:

```solidity
uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
  revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
}
```

this sTokenBalance later is recorded:

```solidity
  uint256 _withdrawalCycleIndex = _currentCycleIndex + 2;

  WithdrawalCycleDetail storage withdrawalCycle = withdrawalCycleDetails[
    _withdrawalCycleIndex
  ];

  /// Cache existing requested amount for the cycle for the sender
  uint256 _oldRequestAmount = withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender];
  withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender] = _sTokenAmount;

  unchecked {
    /// Update total requested withdrawal amount for the cycle considering existing requested amount
    if (_oldRequestAmount > _sTokenAmount) {
      withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested -= (_oldRequestAmount -
        _sTokenAmount);
    } else {
      withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested += (_sTokenAmount -
        _oldRequestAmount);
    }
  }
```

A user can game the system by using flashloan, for example, the user hold 100 sToken, and he wish to be able to withdraw in any cycle instead of wait for 2 cycles, he also wish to withdraw any amount, maybe more than 100 sToken.

Starting cycle 1, he can use flashloan to game the system: let us assume that is sToken flashloan pool, 

- the user borrow sToken flashloan and inflate the balance of sToken of msg.sender to 1000000000000 amount of token, 
- the code uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender) will think the user attemps to withdraw 10000000 amount of token, 
- then he calls requestWithdraw and repay the flashloan.

He is able to withdraw any amount starting cycle 3.

He can do the same thing in Cycle 2 to make sure he can withdraw any amount in cycle 4

He can do the same thing in Cycle 3 to make sure he can withdraw any amount in cycle 5 and meanwhile he is able to withdraw any amount in cycle 3.

So starting cycle 3, User can withdrawal in any cycle and can withdraw any amount. The issue is that, if the seller is able to remove fund from the protection any time, he can just front-run the transaction that lock the capital of the seller and remove fund before the captial is locked to not cover the lending pool default 

Then the protection pool buyer lost the premium to seller while seller's risk of covering the default is minimal.

## Impact

the protection pool buyer lost the premium to seller while seller's risk of covering the default is minimal. if Seller can withdraw in any cycle and can withdraw any amount with the help of flashloan

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol lock the requested sToken amount in the ProtectionPool when user make the withdrawal and definitely not relies on the current balance of msg.sender to derive the amount of token withdrawal requested.
