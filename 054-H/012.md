# Withdraw request can be made without funds - Bypass Withdraw Delay

## Summary
It was observed that withdraw request is executed post 2 cycles of request creation. This could be tricked by attacker to create a withdraw request for funds which does not even exist. This allows attacker to withdraw funds early than required delay as shown in POC

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume User has a balance of amount 5
2. User request withdrawal which internally calls `_requestWithdrawal` function for amount 5

```solidity
function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }
...
}
```

3. Since User has sufficient balance so withdrawal request is accepted. Lets say current cycle is `x` then _withdrawalCycleIndex will be `x+2`
4. Now at cycle `x+1`, User again calls to withdraw amount 5. Ideally this should be rejected as User already raised a withdrawal request which will allow him to wipe out his entire amount 5
5. But since the check is made between withdraw amount and User balance (which is still 5), so the withdraw request is accepted

```solidity
function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 _sTokenBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_sTokenAmount > _sTokenBalance) {
      revert InsufficientSTokenBalance(msg.sender, _sTokenBalance);
    }
...
}
```

6. This means now we have 2 withdraw request each of amount 5

```solidity
User balance : 5

Request 1:
Created at cycle: x
Execute at cycle : x+2
Amount: 5

Request 2:
Created at cycle: x+1
Execute at cycle : x+3
Amount: 5
```

7. This means if User make a deposit at cycle x+3, he can instantly withdraw it without waiting since one execution is pending at cycle `x+3`

## Impact
Attacker can withdraw funds without even waiting for 2 cycles post request creation

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If a withdraw is requested in cycle `i` then `balanceOf(msg.sender) - the amount requested in cycle i-1` should be considered as user balance.
