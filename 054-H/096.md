# Users can share/borrow sTokens to bypass minimum deposit time

## Summary

_requestWithdrawal allows users to request a withdrawal up to their current amount of sTokens. This prevents the user from requesting a withdraw before they deposit to game the withdrawal system. The current safeguards are not sufficient however. Users can easily bypass this requirement by borrowing or sharing sTokens between themselves. User A transfers to User B who then uses those tokens to request a withdrawal for themselves then sends the token back to User B. Now User B has a withdraw scheduled for cycle n+2. They can now deposit in that cycle n+2 while maintaining full liquidity due to their requested withdrawal from cycle n, bypassing the minimum locking time. 

This could also be abused to deploy a liquidity-on-demand service, where a contract keeps constant withdraws queued to service other users that want to bypass minimum deposit times. When a user wished to redeem their tokens they would transfer to tokens to the contract with the withdrawal allowance and withdraw via the contract for a fee.
