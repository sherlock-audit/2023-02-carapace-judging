# Protection seller can bypass the withdrawal cycle restriction by placing withdrawal requests in advance

## Summary
`requestWithdrawal` allows a protection seller to first place a request for withdrawal. Actual withdrawal is allowed in the `open` state that comes after 1 full pool cycle is completed. This restriction is imposed so that sellers don't exit enmasse when underlying loan pool borrowers show signs of weakness (or market rumors around borrower credit risk).

Protocol also mentions that a secondary market for `sTokens` on Uniswap will exist. Users who don't want to lock up their capital can swap `sTokens` on Uniswap. However, this creates a loophole. A malicious seller can flashswap `sTokens`, place a withdraw request and pay back the `sTokens` immediately. Now that a withdrawal request is placed in advance, users can make the actual deposit anytime in the next cycle & exit much faster.

Protocol is tricked into thinking that the request is genuine. In effect sellers can deposit and withdraw at will. Cost of executing this attack is just the gas fees but the benefit is huge - a protection seller can jump the queue if loans start going bad and exit before others can

## Vulnerability Detail
[`_requestWithdrawal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1088) checks user balance and places a request that is redeemable 2 cycles later.

```solidity
function _requestWithdrawal(uint256 _sTokenAmount) internal {
    ...
   unchecked {
      /// Update total requested withdrawal amount for the cycle considering existing requested amount
      if (_oldRequestAmount > _sTokenAmount) {
        withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested -= (_oldRequestAmount -
          _sTokenAmount);
      } else {
        withdrawalCycle.totalSTokenRequested += (_sTokenAmount -
          _oldRequestAmount);
      }
    }
    ...
    }
```

Whitepaper suggests the existence of secondary market in Uniswap.

_"If sellers wish to redeem their capital and interest before the lockup period, they might be able to find a buyer of their SToken in a secondary market like Uniswap"_

Combining the above 2, seller can do a flashswap to receive `sTokens` and place a withdraw request - once request placed, seller will return `sTokens` to pool. Seller does not have any intent to deposit capital in current cycle.

In the next cycle, seller buys actual protection and receives `sTokens`. Then when that cycle ends and pool agains goes into `Open` state, seller can call [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L232) function

Note that there is no check on withdraw function to verify if the user indeed existed 2 cycles before. Only verification is if amount request > withdrawal request

```solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 _sTokenWithdrawalAmount, address _receiver)
    external
    override
    whenPoolIsOpen
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
  {
    ...
    /// Step 2: Verify withdrawal request exists in this withdrawal cycle for the user
    uint256 _sTokenRequested = withdrawalCycle.withdrawalRequests[msg.sender];
    if (_sTokenRequested == 0) {
      revert NoWithdrawalRequested(msg.sender, _currentCycleIndex);
    }

    /// Step 3: Verify that withdrawal amount is not more than the requested amount.
    if (_sTokenWithdrawalAmount > _sTokenRequested) {
      revert WithdrawalHigherThanRequested(msg.sender, _sTokenRequested);
    }
    ...
}

```

## Impact
Sellers can place advance withdrawal requests & then deposit/withdraw at will without respecting the lockup period. Malicious seller can jump the queue of withdrawal requests placed by genuine sellers. 

In times of borrower distress, `exchangeRate` will drop as `lockedCapital` keeps increasing - in those times, faster exit directly translates to lesser losses. 

If someone is allowed to exit the queue earlier, then that opportunity cost will directly result in losses to genuine sellers who lost their turn.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The withdrawal design currently implemented is inconsistent with a freely trading secondary market on Uniswap. One possible solution could have been to snapshot `sTokens` multiple times within a given pool cycle - but a Uniswap LP would mean that some genuine users also would transfer their `sTokens` to liquidity pool & hence lose out when snapshots are taken.

A possible solution could be to offer `wsToken`, a ERC1155 wrapper around current `sTokens`, to protection sellers on deposit. `sToken` quantity, exchange rate calculations etc remain unchanged. Only advantage is that `wsStoken` ownership can be clearly established enabling a better control on token withdrawal lockups. 

Maybe dev team & my fellow auditors can come up with better solutions - haven't thought through deep enough.
