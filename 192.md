# Seller can request multiple withdrawals using same sTokens by using multiple addresses

## Summary
Seller can request multiple withdrawals using same sTokens by using multiple addresses. This will allow him to deposit protection without risk two cycles in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail
Withdrawal requests are stored by msg.sender
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L1083

This allows seller to game the withdrawal mechanism using the following actions
- Deposit protection during cycle 1
- From address1 request withdrawal scheduled for cycle 3
- Transfer the tokens to address2
- Request withdrawal from address2 scheduled for cycle 3

Seller managed to create withdrawals for the amount twice larger than the amount of sTokens he possesses. As a result, during cycle 3 he will be able to make deposits from address1 and withdraw during the same cycle. This will allow seller to collect premiums without risk of default as he will be able to front-run locking transactions and withdraw funds.

## Impact
Locking mechanism can be gamed. Sellers will be able to earn premium without default risk

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perhaps it is better to lock sTokens when withdrawal is requested
