# CONSOLE LOG MESSAGES FOR THE HARDHAT FRAMEWORK CAN BE REMOVED IN PRODUCTION CODE

## Summary

In the code base there are multiple occasions where the `console.log()` is used by importing the `hardhat/console.sol`. This is a good practice for testing purposes. But can be removed going into production stage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `console.log()` used in the codebase seems to be added for the testing purpose of the code and can be removed. For the off chain tools and other data verification purposes, `events` can be used instead.  

## Impact
The `console.log()` used in the codebase can incur additional deployment gas cost. And in some cases could leak sensitive information about the protocol which are intended to be made public.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
      console.log(
        "lendingPool: %s, lastPremiumAccrualTimestamp: %s, latestPaymentTimestamp: %s",
        _lendingPool,
        _lastPremiumAccrualTimestamp,
        _latestPaymentTimestamp
      );
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the `console.log()` code snippets from the production code. If there is a requirement to analyze and verify protocol data off chain `events` should be used instead.
