# `movePoolPhase()` does not check the floor limit

## Summary
`movePoolPhase` is missing a check for the leverage ratio when moving to open phase.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the docs:
```c
OpenToBuyers: Buyers can buy protections, but sellers can not deposit funds into the pool.
Once the Leverage ratio is within the floor and ceiling range, the pool can be moved to the next phase
```

It is however currently only checking the ceiling range:

```solidity
File: contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol
540:       if (calculateLeverageRatio() <= poolInfo.params.leverageRatioCeiling) {
541:         poolInfo.currentPhase = _newPhase = ProtectionPoolPhase.Open;
542:         emit ProtectionPoolPhaseUpdated(_newPhase);
543:       }
```

## Impact
The code breaks the requirements, making it possible for a pool to move to the `Open` phase with a leverage ratio below the floor level.
