# [M-01] Reentrancy

## Summary

There is a reentrant function.

## Vulnerability Detail

`safeMint` opens a reentrancy attack vector.

## Impact

The recipient contract may define any arbitrary logic to be executed from `_deposit` function. However the recommended check-effect-interaction coding pattern is followed, still reentrancy is possible so medium severity matches.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
1037: _safeMint(_receiver, _sTokenShares);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

One of the following options should be implemented:

1. As OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard library is imported, add `nonReentrant` modifier to the `_deposit` function.

2. Add custom function execution locking functianality.
