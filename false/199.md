# Sellers can deposit protection right after borrower payment and before accrual gaining an advantage

## Summary
If seller deposits capital right after borrower makes a payment but before accrual is done, he earns this portion of premium without any risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
Carapace integrates with on-chain protocols like Goldfinch, which means borrower payments are visible on-chain. Seller can deposit protection right after borrower makes a payment but before `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` is called on `ProtectionPool`.

Seller will earn premium associated with made payment risk-free.

## Impact
Seller can earn small portion of premium risk-free. Ranking as Low as it is unlikely to have a big impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If possible within reasonable gas limit, we can call `accruePremiumAndExpireProtections` at the beginning of `deposit` function like the following:

```solidity
  function deposit(uint256 _underlyingAmount, address _receiver)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
  {
    accruePremiumAndExpireProtections(new address[](0));
    _deposit(_underlyingAmount, _receiver);
  }
```
