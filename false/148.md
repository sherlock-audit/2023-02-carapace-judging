# Functions are marked as payable for gas optimization but contracts cannot retrieve ether

## Summary

Functions are marked as payable for gas optimization but contracts cannot retrieve ether.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Many functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace-MalfurionWhitehat/search?q=payable) from the protocol are are marked as `payable` for [gas optimizations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IProtectionPool.sol#L322), but none of these contracts have any methods for retrieving lost ether, which might end up there due to user mistake or donations. 

Since the smart contracts are upgradeable using the Open-Zeppelin library and UUPS proxy pattern, it would be necessary to upgrade the contract in order to retrieve lost funds from users.

## Impact

Lost ether cannot be retrieved without a contract upgrade.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a function to retrieve lost ether on the contract guarded by the `onlyOwner` modifier.
