# # [M-02] Unsafe casting of user amount from uint256 to int128

## Summary

The unsafe casting of the recovered amount from uint256 to int128 means the premium calculation will be wrong.

## Vulnerability Details

In `calculatePremium` function, `minCarapaceRiskPremiumPercent` is downcast from uint256 to int128. 

For example in case owner of the lending pool updates the risk parameters and want to update it to `type(uint256).max` or any number more than 2^128-1 (mistakenly or intend to prevent users to buy more protection) and assume that it will works.

However the `minCarapaceRiskPremiumPercent` will be overflow and return -1 and the logic to check minimum premium will be bypassed. Malicious buyers could manipulate the risk premimum percentage to reduce the charged premium.

## Impact

Number overflow leads to bug in calculating `minCarapaceRiskPremiumPercent`, it could lead to under calculation of premium.

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeCast library when casting from uint256 to int128. It'd better be prudent than sorry when edge case happens.
