# if underlying token will start charge fee on transfers, it will break the deposit() and depositAndRequestWithdrawal() logic

## Summary
In ```ProtectionPool```  there are  functions ```deposit()``` and ```depositAndRequestWithdrawal()``` , which accepts USDC, SToken.  And the list may extend.But if any of these tokens will start charge fee on transfers, the logic will be broken and resulting in the loss of funds in the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _deposit(uint256 _underlyingAmount, address _receiver) internal {
    /// Verify that the pool is not in OpenToBuyers phase
    if (poolInfo.currentPhase == ProtectionPoolPhase.OpenToBuyers) {
      revert ProtectionPoolInOpenToBuyersPhase();
    }

    uint256 _sTokenShares = convertToSToken(_underlyingAmount);
    totalSTokenUnderlying += _underlyingAmount;
    _safeMint(_receiver, _sTokenShares);
    poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
      msg.sender,
      address(this),
      _underlyingAmount
    );

    /// Verify leverage ratio only when total capital/sTokenUnderlying is higher than minimum capital requirement
    if (_hasMinRequiredCapital()) {
      /// calculate pool's current leverage ratio considering the new deposit
      uint256 _leverageRatio = calculateLeverageRatio();

      if (_leverageRatio > poolInfo.params.leverageRatioCeiling) {
        revert ProtectionPoolLeverageRatioTooHigh(_leverageRatio);
      }
    }

    emit ProtectionSold(_receiver, _underlyingAmount);
  }

```
The ```_deposit()``` function is used to deposits the specified amount of underlying token to the pool and mints the corresponding sToken shares to the receiver. Inside the function, it first converts the ```_underlyingAmount``` to stoken share. Then ```totalSTokenUnderlying += _underlyingAmount``` . Next, mint the corresponding sToken shares to the receiver. Finally, transfer asset form msg.sender to protocol. However ,if  the underlying token  will start charge fee on transfers, there is a mismatch between the number of tokens received in the protocol and the number credited. The protocol will mint more sToken shares to the receiver. When the user withdraws asset he will get more tokens and and resulting in the loss of funds in the protocol.


## Impact
Resulting in the loss of funds in the protocol.

## Recommendation
To avoid problems, use common pattern, when you check your balance before operation and balance after, like that:

```solidity
   uint256 balanceBefore = poolInfo.underlyingToken.balanceOf(address(this));

    poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
      msg.sender,
      address(this),
      _underlyingAmount
    );

   uint256 balanceAfter = poolInfo.underlyingToken.balanceOf(address(this));

   uint256 tokenAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

    uint256 _sTokenShares = convertToSToken(tokenAmount );

    totalSTokenUnderlying += tokenAmount ;

    _safeMint(_receiver, _sTokenShares);

```
