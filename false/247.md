# `ContractFactory` does not reserve space for upgrades

## Summary

`ContractFactory` does not reserve space for upgrades

## Vulnerability Detail

`ContractFactory` is `UUPSUpgradeableBase`. Due to the fact that upgrades in future may require possibility of adding new variables, a storage gap should be added to prevent storage collision in future.

## Impact

Storage collisions in case an upgrade requires additional storage variables.

## Recommendation

Add `uint256[50] private __gap;` to prevent possible storage collision during an upgrade.
