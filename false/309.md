# `_deposit()` FUNCTION SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR TRANSFER FEES OF THE UNDERLYING `erc20` TOKENS

## Summary

In the `_deposit()` function of the `ProtectionPool.sol` contract, underlying token with amount `_underlyingAmount`  is passed in as an input parameter which is used to calculate the SToken shares `_sTokenShares`. The function `convertToSToken()` is used for this and the `_underlyingAmount` is passed into it as the input parameter. Later `_underlyingAmount` is transfered to the contract using the `safeTransferFrom`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_underlyingAmount` should not be directly used to calculate the `_sTokenShares` of the contract. Since the actual passed in `erc20` token amount could be less than the exact value of `_underlyingAmount`. This could happen due to transfer fees deducted by the respective `erc20` token contract. 

## Impact

If there is token transfer fee logic is implemented in the underlying `erc20` token used for the protection pool, the exact deposited underlying token amount by the protection seller could be less than the passed in `_underlyingAmount`. This would mean additional SToken will be minted for the `_receiver` thus giving him an unfair advantage. This could make the calculations related to the total STokens of the contract and total underlying token amount deposited, erroneous. Because there will be more STokens minted than the total underlying tokens deposited thus making the exchange rate logic calculations erroneous.  This could further prompt unexpected behaviour of the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    uint256 _sTokenShares = convertToSToken(_underlyingAmount);
    totalSTokenUnderlying += _underlyingAmount;
    _safeMint(_receiver, _sTokenShares);
    poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
      msg.sender,
      address(this),
      _underlyingAmount
    ); 
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the actual transferred underlying `erc20` token amount to calculate the SToken amount to be minted to the `_receiver`. The balance before the token transfer and balance after the token transfer can be used to calculate the actual transferred underlying token to the contract rather than using the passed in `_underlyingAmount` directly.

The code snippet can be changed as follows:

```solidity
    uint256 _amountBeforeTransfer = poolInfo.underlyingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
      msg.sender,
      address(this),
      _underlyingAmount
    ); 
    uint256 _amountAfterTransfer = poolInfo.underlyingToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 _actualTransferedAmount = amountAfterTransfer - amountBeforeTransfer;
    uint256 _sTokenShares = convertToSToken(_actualTransferedAmount);
    totalSTokenUnderlying += _actualTransferedAmount;
    _safeMint(_receiver, _sTokenShares);	
```
