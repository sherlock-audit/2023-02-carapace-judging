# NO STORAGE GAP FOR UPGRADEABLE CONTRACTS

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
inheriting contracts may introduce new variables. In order to be able to add new variables to the upgradeable abstract contract without causing storage collisions, a storage gap should be added to the upgradeable abstract contract.

If no storage gap is added, when the upgradable abstract contract introduces new variables, it may override the variables in the inheriting contract.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/UUPSUpgradeableBase.sol#L14-L18

```solidity
abstract contract UUPSUpgradeableBase is
  Initializable,
  OwnableUpgradeable,
  UUPSUpgradeable
{
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a storage gap at the end of the upgradeable abstract contract

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
