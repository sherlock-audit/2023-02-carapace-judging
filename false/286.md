# Fee on transfer token support

## Summary

Fee on transfer token (USDT could turn on transfer fee), in `_deposit()` and new protection creation, the contract might receive less amount than expected, and later could result in transfer failure for payouts.


## Vulnerability Detail

For fee on transfer tokens, the actual transferred amount will be less, so in `_deposit()` the deposit amount will be less than the intended amount, the premium received by the protocol will also be less, and later could result in payout failure due to low balance. 

```solidity
File: contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol

900:     poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
901:       msg.sender,
902:       address(this),
903:       _premiumAmount
904:     );

1038:     poolInfo.underlyingToken.safeTransferFrom(
1039:       msg.sender,
1040:       address(this),
1041:       _underlyingAmount
1042:     );
```


## Impact

For `_deposit()` and new protection creation, the protocol will receive less than intended. Later in default payout, the transfer could fail due to low balance.
For popular token like USDT, if the fee option is toggled on, these functions will be affected.

## Recommendation

Check the balance before and after the transferFrom, use the actual transferred amount for accounting.
