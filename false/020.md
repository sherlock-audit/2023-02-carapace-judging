# Ether can not be rescued if sent to the protocol

## Summary
Ether can not be rescued if sent to the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
Payable is used in many functions for gas optimisation but if ether is sent to the protocol mistakenly, it will be locked permanently.

## Impact
Ether is stuck in the protocol. although most of those functions are callable only by the owner, there is still chance to occur.

## Code Snippet
Check functions of **ProtectionPool** such as `updateLeverageRatioParams`, `updateRiskPremiumParams` and `updateMinRequiredCapital` ...etc.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 require msg.value == 0 or just add a function to rescue ether in case it occurs.
