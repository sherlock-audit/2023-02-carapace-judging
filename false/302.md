# Issue in Logic of `_startNewCycle` through `calculateAndSetPoolCycleState`

## Summary

Setting value of `_poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime` as `block.timestamp` can lead to issue while moving from current cycle to a new cycle.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_startNewCycle` when called through `calculateAndSetPoolCycleState` to update and add a new cycle, it takes `block.timestamp` of that time as timestamp rather than ending time of previous cycle.

## Impact

Logic of `getNextCycleEndTimestamp` can be incorrect and there is a cycle is extended which is not supposed to happen.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: ProtectionPoolCycleManager.sol

    if (
        block.timestamp - poolCycle.currentCycleStartTime >
        poolCycle.params.cycleDuration
      ) {
        /// move current cycle to a new cycle
        _startNewCycle(
          _protectionPoolAddress,
          poolCycle,
          poolCycle.currentCycleIndex + 1
        );
        _newState = ProtectionPoolCycleState.Open;
      }


```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Send the `currentCycleStartTime` as parameter. Send `block.timestamp` for new cycle and end time of first cycle for moving the cycle to new cycle.
