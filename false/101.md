# The cronjob `DefaultStateManager.assessStates` can become more costly than how it should be

## Summary
The `DefaultStateManager`, but in general the protocol, does not consider if a protection pool is not used anymore, (e.g. pool in a default situation or unregistered pool). It is more correct to say that it does consider if a protection pool is in a default situation, but not sufficiently, in particular on the cronjob `DefaultStateManager.assessStates` which can become more costly than how it should be. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `DefaultStateManager.assessStates` function does traverse the list of pools by calling `_assessState(protectionPoolStates[_poolIndex]);` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L119-L134). Then inside `DefaultStateManager._assessState` we check if the protection pool given is not in a default state (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol#L365-L369). But before that happens, we have several external calls + storage accesses, which we might do not want to care about, but that actually becomes something of matters when we think that this is a function that will be called at least once in day, if more.

## Impact
carapace losing funds on gas costs

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a field to struct `ProtectionPoolState` stating if it is in a default situation and so not used anymore. Then modify for-loop inside function `DefaultStateManager.assessStates` by checking that the current `ProtectionPoolState` is not in a default state.
