# [M-03] Wrong pausing functionality

## Summary

`_deposit` function can still be called despite the fact that the contract is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail

Wrong pausing functionality implementation.

## Impact

All state-changing methods should be pausable, especially all inbound ones. This is a serious security issue due to the fact that it could still be deposits of underlying tokens to the pool and the corresponding sToken shares minting to the receiver while the contract is paused. Therefore, medium severity fits well.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
1029: function _deposit(uint256 _underlyingAmount, address _receiver) internal {
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `whenNotPaused()` modifier to the `_deposit` function.
