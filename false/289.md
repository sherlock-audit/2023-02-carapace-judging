# missing default payouts calculation

## Summary 
 There isn't any function used to calculate default payouts in the protectionpool incase of a default event occurrying causing the whole mechanism of the system to break.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is non-custodial automated market maker where buyers of a protection hedge against a default risk of a specific underlying lending pool. Therefore, if a lending pool defaults buyers of the protections should be paid out. unfortunately, there isn't any way of calculating default payouts which renders the mechanism of the system.
#Impact
This is a critical severity issue in that, not only is default payouts used to pay buyers of protections but it is also used in calculating the _totalStokenunderlying_ hence providing wrong information for the function _getpooldetails_. Also it will lead to wrong figures when calculating the exchange rate in the function _getexchangerate__.
