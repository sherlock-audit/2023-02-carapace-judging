# Ownership might be comprised due to '_transferOwnership'

## Summary
During the initialization of the **ProtectionPool.sol** contract, the ownership of the contract might be transferred to a zero or invalid address which can compromise the ownership of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The **_transferOwnership()** used in the **initialize()** function of ProtectionPool.sol contract to transfer ownership of the contract. However, this allows only a single-step ownership change which does not check if the input address is an invalid or zero address. And because the **initialize()** function can only be called once,  the ownership of this contract might be lost to an invalid address.

`_transferOwnership(_owner);`
## Impact
Ownership of the ProtectionPool.sol contract might be lost forever to an invalid or incorrect address.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function initialize(
    address _owner,
    ProtectionPoolInfo calldata _poolInfo,
    IPremiumCalculator _premiumCalculator,
    IProtectionPoolCycleManager _poolCycleManager,
    IDefaultStateManager _defaultStateManager,
    string calldata _name,
    string calldata _symbol
  ) external override initializer {
    /// initialize parent contracts in same order as they are inherited to mimic the behavior of a constructor
    __UUPSUpgradeableBase_init();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    __sToken_init(_name, _symbol);

    /// set the storage variables
    poolInfo = _poolInfo;
    premiumCalculator = _premiumCalculator;
    poolCycleManager = _poolCycleManager;
    defaultStateManager = _defaultStateManager;

    emit ProtectionPoolInitialized(
      _name,
      _symbol,
      poolInfo.underlyingToken,
      poolInfo.referenceLendingPools
    );

    /// Transfer the ownership of this pool to the specified owner
    _transferOwnership(_owner);

    /// Add dummy protection info to make index 0 invalid
    protectionInfos.push();
  }
```

## Recommendation
Consider using the **'transferOwnership()'** function of [Openzeppelin's OwnableUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol) contract instead of **'_transferOwnership()'**
