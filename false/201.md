# If new underlying lending protocol that doesn't provide NFTs that represents a deposit to be added as a LendingProtocolAdapter in the future, it will be always reverted

## Summary
If new underlying lending protocol that doesn't provide NFTs that represents a deposit to be added as a LendingProtocolAdapter in the future, it will be always reverted when the ProtectionPoolHelper# `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection()` would be called via the the ProtectionPool# `renewProtection()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the IReferenceLendingPools,
the `nftLpTokenId` is defined in the `ProtectionPurchaseParams` struct like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/IReferenceLendingPools.sol#L40
```solidity
struct ProtectionPurchaseParams {
  /// @notice address of the lending pool where the buyer has a lending position
  address lendingPoolAddress;

  /// @notice Id of ERC721 LP token received by the buyer to represent the deposit in the lending pool
  /// Buyer has to specify `nftTokenId` when underlying protocol provides ERC721 LP token, i.e. Goldfinch
  uint256 nftLpTokenId;  /// @audit 

  /// @notice the protection amount in underlying tokens
  uint256 protectionAmount;

  /// @notice the protection duration in seconds
  uint256 protectionDurationInSeconds;
}
```

Within the ProtectionPool# `renewProtection()`, 
the ProtectionPoolHelper# `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection()` would be called and the `ProtectionPurchaseParams` struct in the form of the `_protectionPurchaseParams` would be assigned into there as an argument value like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol#L184
```solidity
  function renewProtection(
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount
  ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    /// Verify that user can renew protection
    ProtectionPoolHelper.verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection(
      protectionBuyerAccounts,
      protectionInfos,
      _protectionPurchaseParams,  /// @audit 
      poolInfo.params.protectionRenewalGracePeriodInSeconds
    );
    ...
```

Within the ProtectionPoolHelper# `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection()`, 
- the `_protectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId` (`ProtectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId`) would be assigned for retrieving the `_renewalProtectionIndex` like below:
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L369

- then, the _renewalProtectionIndex` is used for the condition that the transaction will be reverted if `_renewalProtectionIndex == 0` like this:  
   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/ProtectionPoolHelper.sol#L371-L373
```solidity
  function verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection(
    mapping(address => ProtectionBuyerAccount) storage protectionBuyerAccounts,
    ProtectionInfo[] storage protectionInfos,
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _renewalGracePeriodInSeconds
  ) external view {
    uint256 _renewalProtectionIndex = protectionBuyerAccounts[msg.sender]
      .expiredProtectionIndexByLendingPool[
        _protectionPurchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress
      ][_protectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId];  /// @audit 

    if (_renewalProtectionIndex == 0) { /// @audit 
      revert IProtectionPool.NoExpiredProtectionToRenew(); /// @audit 
    }
...
```

Within the ProtectionPoolHelper# `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection()` above, the `ProtectionPurchaseParams.nftLpTokenId` is required for both the conditions above.

However, this condition only consider the case that an underlying lending protocol that provide a NFT to depositors as a representation of deposit (i.e. Goldfinch) would be used as a LendingProtocolAdapter.
if the underlying lending protocol that does not provide a NFT to depositors as a representation of deposits would be used as a LendingProtocolAdapter, the `_renewalProtectionIndex` within the ProtectionPoolHelper# `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection()` above would be always `0` and then it will be always reverted at the condition of `if (_renewalProtectionIndex == 0)` above.

NOTEï¼š
- For the moment, although there is no problem because underlying lending protocol accepted is only **Goldfinch** as a **LendingProtocolAdapter**, this should be considered in order for new underlying lending protocol that doesn't provide NFTs that represent deposit to be added as a LendingProtocolAdapter in the future.
  - i.e). Aave provide ERC20 token (`aToken`) as a representation of deposit.
  - i.e). Compound provide ERC20 token (`cToken`) as a representation of deposit.

## Impact
If new underlying lending protocol that doesn't provide NFTs that represents a deposit to be added as a LendingProtocolAdapter in the future, it will be always reverted when the ProtectionPoolHelper# `verifyBuyerCanRenewProtection()` would be called via the the ProtectionPool# `renewProtection()`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a validation to check whether or not the underlying lending protocol used as a LendingProtocolAdapter would be a lending protocol that does not provide a NFT to depositors as a representation of deposit in advance. Also,  Adding the process for the case that a lending protocol that does not provide a NFT to depositors as a representation of deposit would be used as a LendingProtocolAdapter should be considered.
