# Mismatch for Risk Factor formula

## Summary
`calculateRiskFactor()` computes the risk factor differently than what is documented.

## Vulnerability Detail

The comment says the denominator should be `(currentLeverageRatio - leverageRatioFloor - BUFFER)`, while in the code it actually is `(currentLeverageRatio - (leverageRatioFloor - BUFFER)) = (currentLeverageRatio - leverageRatioFloor + BUFFER)`
```solidity
File: contracts/libraries/RiskFactorCalculator.sol
26: * Formula for Risk Factor:
27:    * curvature * ((leverageRatioCeiling + BUFFER - currentLeverageRatio) / (currentLeverageRatio - leverageRatioFloor - BUFFER))
```

```solidity
File: contracts/libraries/RiskFactorCalculator.sol
53:     int256 _denominator = int256(_currentLeverageRatio) -
54:       int256(_leverageRatioFloor - _leverageRatioBuffer);
```

## Impact
The risk factor computed as per the comments is higher than what it is in reality, which can be confusing and lead to unexpected results for end-users.
