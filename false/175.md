# Protection buyer premium calculation uses 365.24 days in a year but Goldfinch uses 365 days

## Summary

Protection buyer premium calculation uses 365.24 days in a year but Goldfinch uses 365 days, which leads to a lower premium paid by protection buyers.

## Vulnerability Detail

`PremiumCalculator.calculatePremium` uses `Constants.SCALED_DAYS_IN_YEAR`, i.e., [`36524`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Constants.sol#L13-L15
), as the number of scaled days in a year, while Goldfinch uses [365 days](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/commit/433f038259406ef2cb623ecc10f7e3a2bca505e2#diff-490f3e1fd3f3fed361670c128ed3374c07354aaf62631b46c6ad720de386d79b) (or `36500` scaled).

As a result, inconsistencies will be carried up in APY calculation between Carapace's calculation and the reference lending pool (in this case, Goldfinch).

More specifically, using a higher value for "days in year" constant [will lead](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/PremiumCalculator.sol#L157-L170) to a [lower `_durationInYears`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/PremiumCalculator.sol#L57-L60), and thus to a lower [_premiumAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/core/PremiumCalculator.sol#L81-L84). 

This means that protection buyers pay a lower premium than what they should. 

Proof of concept:
1. User lends money in Goldfinch for 365 days
2. User buys a protection in Carapace for exactly 365 days, which is what they need for Goldfinch. This will translate to 0.9993 years in `PremiumCalculator` calculations
3. User will need to pay a premium corresponding to less than a whole year in Carapace

## Impact

Protection buyers pay a lower premium than what they should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use 365 days in a year for APY calculation and guarantee that appropriate conversions are performed on integrated reference lending pools.
