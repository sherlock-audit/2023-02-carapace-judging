# `calculateRiskFactor` reverts when the buffer is greater than the floor



## Summary
`RiskFactorCalculator.calculateRiskFactor` reverts when buffer > floor so the admin can't use leverage parameters  if buffer is greater than floor.

## Vulnerability Detail

`RiskFactorCalculator` calculates the risk factor as follows.

`
risk factor = curvature * numerator / denominator
`

The denominator is noted as follows in the documentation.

`
leverage_ratio - (LEVERAGE_RATIO_FLOOR - BUFFER)
`

And the implementation is the same as the documentation.
```solidity
int256 _denominator = int256(_currentLeverageRatio) -
      int256(_leverageRatioFloor - _leverageRatioBuffer);
```
But if `_leverageRatioFloor` < `_leverageRatioBuffer`, this calculation will revert from underflow. But _currentLeverageRatio is always greater than _leverageRatioFloor so we can calculate it without revert when `_leverageRatioFloor` < `_leverageRatioBuffer`. From the test of `RiskFactorCalculator`, I can guess the default values are 0.1 for floor and 0.05 for buffer. So it won't be a problem for the default values. But the admin can't use values floor < buffer in the current implementation because the implementation doesn't consider this case.

And the comment in Line 25 is also incorrect for the denominator.

## Impact
The admin can't use leverage parameters if floor is less than the buffer.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add first and then subtract to avoid underflow as follows.
```solidity
int256 _denominator = int256(_currentLeverageRatio + _leverageRatioBuffer - _leverageRatioFloor)
```
