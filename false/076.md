# Risk of integer overflow in the `calculateKAndLambda` function.

## Summary
The `calculateKAndLambda` function in the `AccruedPremiumCalculator` library contract has a potential risk of integer overflow due to casting `uint256` arguments to `int256` and may allow an attacker to exploit the calculation and cause a crash, freeze.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `calculateKAndLambda` function, some of the function arguments are of the `uint256` type. However, these arguments are cast to the `int256` type, which could cause integer overflow errors, It would be safer to have these parameters passed as `int256` in the first place to avoid this risk.

In the code, the `calculateKAndLambda` function takes several "uint256-typed" arguments as input, including `_protectionPremium, _protectionDurationInDays, _currentLeverageRatio, _leverageRatioFloor, _leverageRatioCeiling, _leverageRatioBuffer`, _curvature, and `_minCarapaceRiskPremiumPercent`, the function first checks whether `_minCarapaceRiskPremiumPercent` is greater than zero.

If so, the function calls the `calculateRiskFactorUsingMinPremium` function to calculate `_riskFactor`, Otherwise the function calls the `calculateRiskFactor` function to calculate `_riskFactor`. 
Next, the function calculates `_lambda` by multiplying `_riskFactor` by 100 and dividing the result by `Constants.SCALED_DAYS_IN_YEAR`, which is a constant equal to the number of scaled days in a year, the function calculates `K` using the formula `_protectionPremium / (1 - e^(-1 * _protectionDurationInDays * lambda))`.

So the issue in this code arises because some of the input arguments are cast to `int256` before performing mathematical operations, in particular `_protectionPremium, _protectionDurationInDays, _currentLeverageRatio, _leverageRatioFloor, _leverageRatioCeiling, and _leverageRatioBuffer` are cast to `int256` using implicit conversion, this means that if any of these arguments exceed the maximum value of int256, which is 2^255-1, an integer overflow will occur.

## Impact
An attacker can supply large values for the `uint256` arguments, leading to an integer overflow error, which could cause the transaction to fail or result in unexpected behavior of the system, the attacker could exploit this vulnerability to take advantage of the vulnerability and possibly gain control of the system and steal funds.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-carapace/blob/main/contracts/libraries/AccruedPremiumCalculator.sol#L75-L76

This line casts `_protectionDurationInDays` to an `int256` from a `uint256` and multiplies it with `_lambda`, the results are then divided by `Constants.SCALE_18_DECIMALS_INT`, which is defined as `10**18`.

Since the `_protectionDurationInDays` parameter is a `uint256`, it is possible that the multiplication with `-1` and `_lambda` could result in an integer overflow, causing unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the function arguments of `calculateKAndLambda` from `uint256` to int256 in order to avoid the risk of integer overflow, by passing these parameters as int256 in the first place, it will ensure that they are always in the expected range, and there is no possibility of overflow.
