# `calculateRiskFactor` method in `RiskFactorCalculator` library is Vulnerable to Implicit Underflows

## Summary

`calculateRiskFactor` has Implicit Underflow vulnerability in calculating both numerator and denominator.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are a few underflows that are converted via a typecast afterwards to the expected value.

* `int256(a-b)` where a and b are uint: For example, if `a=1` and `b=2`, then the intermediate result would be `uint(-1) == 2**256-1`
* `int256(-x)` where x is a uint. For example, if `x=1`, then the intermediate result would be `uint(-1) == 2**256-1`

## Impact

As solidity 0.8.x is used, the code would revert. Itâ€™s better not to have underflows by using the appropriate typecasts. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: RiskFactorCalculator.sol

    int256 _numerator = int256(
      (_leverageRatioCeiling + _leverageRatioBuffer) - _currentLeverageRatio
    );

    int256 _denominator = int256(_currentLeverageRatio) -
      int256(_leverageRatioFloor - _leverageRatioBuffer);

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend replacing `int256(a-b)` with `int256(a)-int256(b)`, and replacing `int256(-x)` with `-int256(x)`
