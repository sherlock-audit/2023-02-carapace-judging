# Owner can set invalid leverage ratio floor and ceiling

## Summary
Leverage ratio floor and ceiling can be set by protocol owner , but there is no check to ensure floor is lower than ceiling , if owner set this by wrong it may block pool functionalities .
## Vulnerability Detail
If owner set leverage ratio ceiling lower than floor it will break protocol operations the both deposit and withdraw functionalities may be locked . For example leverage ratio is 5/4 and owner set floor to 2 and ceiling to 1 if this happen no one can buy protection and also no one can sell protection . However if someone withdraw funds or a buy protection expires which changes leverage ratio may cause to open one operation like buy or sell temporary but as leverage ratio goes between ceiling and floor both of them will be locked again .
If this happen during initialization of the pool it can cause pool stuck in opentobuyers phase . 
## Impact
BuyProtection and SellProtection functions will be locked temporary .
