# When ProtectionPool is paused, the buyer has no option to renew the protection while lose the premium to the protection seller.

## Summary

When ProtectionPool is paused, the buyer has no option to renew the protection while losing the premium to the protection seller.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, the owner of the contract can pause or unpause the protection pool:

```solidity
  /// @notice allows the owner to pause the contract
  /// @dev This function is marked as payable for gas optimization.
  function pause() external payable onlyOwner {
    _pause();
  }

  /// @notice allows the owner to unpause the contract
  /// @dev This function is marked as payable for gas optimization.
  function unpause() external payable onlyOwner {
    _unpause();
  }
```

When the contract is paused,

```solidity
  /// @inheritdoc IProtectionPool
  function renewProtection(
    ProtectionPurchaseParams calldata _protectionPurchaseParams,
    uint256 _maxPremiumAmount
  ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

  the buyer has no option to renew the protection while lose the premium to the protection seller. After the contract is unpaused, the selller can just call accruePremiumAndExpireProtections to collect free premium and mark the protection of the buyer expired.

## Impact

When the contract is paused,  the buyer has no option to renew the protection while lose the premium to the protection seller. After the contract is unpaused, the selller can just call accruePremiumAndExpireProtections to collect free premium and mark the protection of the buyer expired.

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol offer the option to let the buyer renew the protection when contract is paused or not letting the seller earn free premium when the contract is paused.
