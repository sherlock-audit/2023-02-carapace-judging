# Protection buyers can buy/renew many protections for a single underlying position

## Summary
Protection buyers can buy/renew as many protection instances as they want for an underlying position.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is supposed to check the underlying pools so that a protection buyer can only buy protection for the amount he might lose. However, it is possible for a protection buyer to buy protection with the same NFT several times, so that when the position is lost he would earn more protection than what he actually lost.

Since the code below only checks the current amount of protection being bought against the underlying principal:
```solidity
    return
      _purchaseParams.protectionAmount <=
      calculateRemainingPrincipal(
        _purchaseParams.lendingPoolAddress,
        _buyer,
        _purchaseParams.nftLpTokenId
      );
```
A buyer can use the NFT to push several protectionInfos for the same position into the array to get xN times protection for the same position.

## Impact
This means that the protocol no more guarantees that the protection earned from the same position is at most the amout lost. And this can be dangerous since it increases the success chance of pool drain attacks and collusions by a high factor.

Check the protection bought for an NFT vs the remaining principal.
