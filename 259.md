# OWNER SOULD BE CHECKED FOR `address(0)` BEFORE `_transferOwnership(_owner)` IS CALLED IN `initialize()` FUNCTION

## Summary

In the `initialize()` function of the `ProtectionPool.sol` contract the address `owner` is passed in as an input parameter. But the input address value is not checked for the `address(0)`. But the same check is correctly performed in the `initialize()` function of the `ReferenceLendingPools.sol` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the `address(0)` is passed in as the input parameter to the `initialize()` function, the ownership will be transferred to the zero address, once the `_transferOwnership(_owner)` is called. 

## Impact

Since the `initialize()` function is called only once in the upgradeable implementation contract, and there is no function to change the ownership of the contract to a different address later, all the `onlyOwner` modifier controlled functions will not be callable. Hence the protocol will not function as intended.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function initialize(
    address _owner,
    ProtectionPoolInfo calldata _poolInfo,
    IPremiumCalculator _premiumCalculator,
    IProtectionPoolCycleManager _poolCycleManager,
    IDefaultStateManager _defaultStateManager,
    string calldata _name,
    string calldata _symbol
  ) external override initializer {
    /// initialize parent contracts in same order as they are inherited to mimic the behavior of a constructor
    __UUPSUpgradeableBase_init();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    __sToken_init(_name, _symbol);

    /// set the storage variables
    poolInfo = _poolInfo;
    premiumCalculator = _premiumCalculator;
    poolCycleManager = _poolCycleManager;
    defaultStateManager = _defaultStateManager;

    emit ProtectionPoolInitialized(
      _name,
      _symbol,
      poolInfo.underlyingToken,
      poolInfo.referenceLendingPools
    );

    /// Transfer the ownership of this pool to the specified owner
    _transferOwnership(_owner); 
    
    /// Add dummy protection info to make index 0 invalid
    protectionInfos.push();
  } 
```

## Tool used

VS Code and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check for address(0) for the passed in `owner` address parameter inside the  `initialize()` function of the `ProtectionPool.sol` contract, as it is done in the `initialize()` function in the `ReferenceLendingPools.sol` contract. Should declare a new Error as `ProtectionPoolConstructionError()` for the revert if the owner is `address(0)`. The following code snippet should be added to the `initialize()` function in the `ProtectionPool.sol` contract.

```solidity
    if (_owner == Constants.ZERO_ADDRESS) {
      revert ProtectionPoolConstructionError(
        "Owner address must not be zero"
      );
    }
```
