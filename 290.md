# Need to update `totalSTokenUnderlying` when unlock capital

## Summary

When change the lending pool status if miss some payments, the `_lockedAmount` is subtracted from `totalSTokenUnderlying`, but later even the late payment is received, the  `_lockedAmount` is not added back to `totalSTokenUnderlying`. The impacts would be inaccurate `totalSTokenUnderlying`, and lots of pool variables depends on this number will also be wrong. Some fund could be locked, some functions will be break.

## Vulnerability Detail

When change the status of the lending pool to "Late", in function `lockCapital()` called by `_moveFromActiveToLockedState()`, `totalSTokenUnderlying` is reduced by `_lockedAmount`. 

```solidity
File: contracts/core/DefaultStateManager.sol
390:   function _moveFromActiveToLockedState()

396:     /// step 1: calculate & lock the capital amount in the protection pool
397:     (uint256 _lockedCapital, uint256 _snapshotId) = _protectionPool.lockCapital(
398:       _lendingPool
399:     );


File: contracts/core/pool/ProtectionPool.sol
357:   function lockCapital(address _lendingPoolAddress)

414:       /// step 3: Update total locked & available capital in storage
415:       if (totalSTokenUnderlying < _lockedAmount) {
416:         /// If totalSTokenUnderlying < _lockedAmount, then lock all available capital
417:         _lockedAmount = totalSTokenUnderlying;
418:         totalSTokenUnderlying = 0;
419:       } else {
420:         /// Reduce the total sToken underlying amount by the locked amount
421:         totalSTokenUnderlying -= _lockedAmount;
422:       }
```

But later, if payment is made and need to change the status from "Late" -> "Active", the `_lockedAmount` is not added back to `totalSTokenUnderlying`:
```solidity
425:   function _moveFromLockedToActiveState(
426:     ProtectionPoolState storage poolState,
427:     address _lendingPool
428:   ) internal {
429:     /// For each lending pool, every active -> late state change creates a new instance of the locked capital.
430:     /// So last item in the array represents the latest state change.
431:     LockedCapital storage lockedCapital = _getLatestLockedCapital(
432:       poolState,
433:       _lendingPool
434:     );
435:     lockedCapital.locked = false;
436: 
437:     emit LendingPoolUnlocked(
438:       _lendingPool,
439:       address(poolState.protectionPool),
440:       lockedCapital.amount
441:     );
442:   }
```

As a result, the `totalSTokenUnderlying` will not reflect the actual underlying amount in the pool, then `exchangeRate` will be inaccurate and affect the `convertToUnderlying()/convertToSToken()` functions. Users could pay/get over or under amounts when deposit/withdraw due to the wrong exchange rate. Also, some fund will be locked, because the unlocked capital is not included in the `totalSTokenUnderlying`, when seller request to withdraw, this part of fund is lost to them.

Also, the `LeverageRatio` will also be wrong. The pool could accept more than designed deposits, and break the `leverageRatioCeiling` limit, taking additional risk. On the other hand, when the underlying amount is low, the system will revert due to too low `LeverageRatio`, prevent buyers to use the system just because of wrong accounting.


## Impact

- the `totalSTokenUnderlying` will be inaccurate
- some fund will be locked
- lots of pool variables depends on this number will also be wrong, such as `exchangeRate`, `LeverageRatio`
- user could get over or under amounts when deposit/withdraw due to the wrong exchange rate
- `leverageRatioCeiling` limit could be break, the sellers could take more risks
- when the pool is on the low underlying token balance, some buyers can not buy protection when they should be able to

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When change the status from "Late" -> "Active", add back `_lockedAmount` to the `totalSTokenUnderlying`.
