# `lockedCapitals` can grow indefenitely and eventually cause `_calculateClaimableAmount` to fail

## Summary
`_calculateClaimableAmount` loops over the whole array of `lockedCapitals`, where it can eventually use more gas and cause the `_calculateClaimableAmount` to fail for certain `lendingPools`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_calculateClaimableAmount` starts from index 0 of the `lockedCapitals` and goes through the whole length. `lockedCapitals` grows for a certain lending pool whenever there is a state transition from `active` to `late` for an underlying lending pool. This can cause the `lockedCapital` to always grow and eventually consumes much more gas than expected which can result in the failure of the transaction, since each transaction's gas limit is capped by block's gas limit.

This vulnerability can also happen for users when they do not claim their capital for a long time, as each unclaimed capital needs more gas to calculate the overall unlocked capital.

## Impact
`lockedCapitals` can cause `_calculateClaimableAmount` to fail consistently after growing larger than a certain amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not start the loop from zero, it would be a good idea to start it from the last claimed amount. There should also be an option where users can claim the capitals for a certain period of time.
