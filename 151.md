# If a `lendingPool` is added to the network while in `late` state, can be defaulted instantly

## Summary
If a lending pool is added to a protection pool, the `defaultStateManager` sets the `currentState` to late without setting the late timestamp. This can enable anyone in the network to be able to call the `_assessState` once more and mark the pool as default.

## Vulnerability Detail
`defaultStateManager` user `_assessState` function to transfer between states. However, in case an underlying pool is called by `_assessState` for the first time when it is added to the protocol. The `_assessState` function sets the `currentState` to `late` without updating the `lateTimestamp` which will remain zero. The attacker can exploit this to move the pool to the default state where it locks the lending pool and renders it unusable.

## Impact
An attacker can render an underlying lending pool unusable.

## Recommendation
The `_assessState` should handle the initial setting of the state seperately.
